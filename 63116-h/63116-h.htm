<p class='c010'>I would acknowledge with particular gratitude the liberality of the <span class='sc'>Hon. Mrs Maxwell-Scott</span>
in allowing the examination and use of the rich store of ballads accumulated
at Abbotsford by her immortal ancestor; and also that of <span class='sc'>Lord Rosebery</span> in sending to
Edinburgh for inspection the collection of rare Scottish broadsides formed by the late
David Laing, and permitting me to print several articles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Rev. S. Baring-Gould</span> has done me the great favor of furnishing me with copies
of traditional ballads and songs taken down by him in the West of England.</p>

<p class='c011'>I am much indebted to the <span class='sc'>Rev. W. Forbes-Leith</span> for his good offices, and to <span class='sc'>Mr Macmath</span>,
as I have been all along, for help of every description.</p>

<p class='c010'>A considerable portion of this eighth number is devoted to texts from Abbotsford.
Many of these were used by Sir <span class='sc'>Walter Scott</span> in the compilation of the Minstrelsy of the
Scottish Border; many, again, not less important than the others, did not find a place in that
collection. They are now printed either absolutely for the first time, or for the first time
without variation from the form in which they were written. All of them, and others which
were obtained in season for the Seventh Part, were transcribed with the most conscientious
and vigilant care by Mr <span class='sc'>Macmath</span>, who has also identified the handwriting, has searched the
numerous volumes of letters addressed to Sir <span class='sc'>Walter Scott</span> for information relating to the
contributors and for dates, and has examined the humbler editions of printed ballads in the
Abbotsford library; this without remitting other help.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very cordial thanks are offered, for texts or information, or for both, to the Rev. <span class='sc'>S. Baring-Gould</span>,
the Rev. <span class='sc'>W. Forbes-Leith</span>, Mr <span class='sc'>Andrew Lang</span>, Dr <span class='sc'>George Birkbeck Hill</span>,
Mr <span class='sc'>P. Z. Round</span>, Dr <span class='sc'>F. J. Furnivall</span>, Mr <span class='sc'>James Barclay Murdoch</span>, Dr <span class='sc'>Giuseppe
Pitrè</span>, of Palermo, Mr <span class='sc'>William Walker</span>, of Aberdeen, Mr <span class='sc'>David MacRitchie</span>, of Edinburgh,
Mr <span class='sc'>James Gibb</span>, of Joppa, Mr <span class='sc'>James Raine</span>, of York, Rev. <span class='sc'>William Leslie
Christie</span>, of London, Mrs <span class='sc'>Mary Thomson</span>, of Fochabers, and Mr <span class='sc'>George M. Richardson</span>,
late of Harvard College; for notes on Slavic popular literature, to Mr <span class='sc'>John Karłowicz</span>,
of Warsaw, and Professor <span class='sc'>Wilhelm Wollner</span>; and for miscellaneous notes, to my colleague,
Professor <span class='sc'>G. L. Kittredge</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>So far as can be foreseen, one part more will bring this book to a close; it is therefore
timely to say again that I shall be glad of any kind of assistance that will make it less
imperfect, whether in the way of supplying omissions or of correcting errors, great or small.</p>

      <div class='line'><b>a.</b> Caw’s Poetical Museum, p. 193.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><b>b.</b> ‘Hobie Noble,’ Percy Papers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Scott’s Minstrelsy, I, 164, 1802, II, 90,
1833. The source is not mentioned, but was
undoubtedly Caw’s Museum, though there
are variations of text, attributable to the editor.
A copy in the Campbell MSS, I, 230,
is again from the Museum, with several corrections,
two of which are also found in Scott.
Caw received the ballad, says Sir Walter, from
John Elliot of Reidheugh. <b>b</b> seems to have
been sent Percy (with ‘Dick o the Cow’) by
Roger Halt, in 1775.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hobie Noble, though banished from Bewcastle
for his irregularities, will always command
the hearty liking of those who live too
late to suffer from them, on account of his
gallant bearing in the rescue of Jock o the
Side. See especially No 187, <b>A</b>, of which
Hobie is the hero. All that we know of him
is so much as we are told in that ballad and
in this. He attached himself, after his expulsion
from England, to the laird of Mangerton,
who gives him the praise ‘Thy coat
is blue, thou has been true.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Sim o the Mains, an Armstrong of the
Whithaugh branch (the most important after
that of Mangerton), undertakes to betray
Hobie to the English land-sergeant. A tryst
is set at Kershope-foot, the junction of that
stream with the Liddel; and Hobie, who
lives a little way up the Liddel, rides eagerly
down the water to keep it. He meets five
men, who ask him to join them in a raid into
England. Hobie dares not go by day; the
land-sergeant is at feud with him on account
of a brother’s death, in which Hobie must
have had a hand, and ‘the great earl of Whitfield’
has suffered from his depredations;<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> but
he will be their guide if they will wait till
night. He takes them to the Foulbogshiel,
where they alight, and word is sent by Sim
to the land-sergeant at Askerton, his adversary’s
residence; the land-sergeant orders the
men of the neighborhood to meet him at daybreak.
Hobie has a bad dream, wakes his
comrades in alarm, and sets out to guide them
across the Waste; but the sergeant’s force
come before him, and Sim behind; his sword
breaks; he is bound with his own bow-string
and taken to Carlisle. As he goes up the
quarter called the Rickergate, the wives say
one to the other, That’s the man that loosed
Jock o the Side! They offer him bread and
beer, and urge him to confess stealing “my
lord’s” horses; he swears a great oath that he
never had beast of my lord’s. He is to die
the next day, and says his farewell to Mangerton;
he would rather be called ‘Hobie
Noble’ and be hanged in Carlisle, than be
called ‘Traitor Mains’ and eat and drink.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr R. B. Armstrong informs me that he
has found no notice of Hobie Noble except
that Hobbe Noble, with eight others, “lived
within the Nyxons, near to Bewcastle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>1569. “Lancy Armistrang of Quhithauch
obliged him&nbsp;... for Sym Armistrang of the
Mains and the rest of the Armistrangis of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>his gang. Syme of the Mains was lodged in
Wester Wemys.” (Register of the Privy
Council of Scotland.)</p>

<p class='c011'>4. The Mains was a place a very little to
the east of Castleton, on the opposite, or north,
side of the Liddel. 13–17. Askerton is in
the Waste of Bewcastle, “about seventeen
miles” northeast of Carlisle. “Willeva and
Spear-Edom [otherwise Spade-Adam] are
small districts in Bewcastle dale, through
which also the Hartlie-burn takes its course.
Conscowthart-Green and Rodric-haugh and
the Foulbogshiel are the names of places in
the same wilds, through which the Scottish
plunderers generally made their raids upon
England.” (Scott.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Sim o the Mains fled into England from
the resentment of his chief, but was himself
executed at Carlisle about two months after
Hobie’s death. “Such is at least the tradition
of Liddesdale,” says Scott. This is of
course, notwithstanding the precision of the
interval of two months, what Lord Bacon
calls “an imagination as one would”; an appendage
of a later generation, in the interest
of poetical justice.</p>

  <h2 id='c190' class='c009'>190<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>JAMIE TELFER OF THE FAIR DODHEAD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, I, 80, 1802; II, 3, 1833.</p>

<p class='c010'>Scott, by whom this ballad was first published,
and to whom alone it seems to be
known, gives us no information how he came
by it. He says, “There is another ballad,
under the same title as the following, in
which nearly the same incidents are narrated,
with little difference except that the honor
of rescuing the cattle is attributed to the
Liddesdale Elliots, headed by a chief, there
called Martin Elliot of the Preakin Tower,
whose son, Simon, is said to have fallen in
the action. It is very possible that both the
Teviotdale Scotts and the Elliots were engaged
in the affair, and that each claimed
the honor of the victory.” Ed. 1833, II. 3.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scott has suggested that an article in the
list of attempts upon England, fouled by the
commissioners at Berwick in the year 1587,
may relate to the subject of the ballad.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thomas Musgrave, de-     { Walter Scott, Laird  } 200 kine and</div>
      <div class='line'>puty of Bewcastle,       { of Buckluth, and his } oxen, 300 gait</div>
      <div class='line'>and the tenants, against { complices; for       } and sheep.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Bewcastle, of which Thomas Musgrave at
the above date was deputy and captain, was,
says Percy, a great rendezvous of thieves and
moss-troopers down to the last century. “It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>is handed down by report,” he remarks, “that@
there was formerly an Order of Council that
no inhabitant of Bewcastle should be returned
on a jury.” That the deputy of the warden,
an officer of the peace, should be exhibited as
making a raid, not in the way of retaliation,
but simply for plunder, is too much out of
rule even for Bewcastle, and does not speak
favorably for the antiquity of the ballad.</p>

<p class='c011'>Taking the story as it stands, the Captain
of Bewcastle, who is looking for a prey, is
taken by a guide to the Fair Dodhead, which
he pillages of kye and everything valuable.
Jamie Telfer, whose threat of revenge the
Captain treats with derision, runs ten miles
afoot to the Elliots of Stobs Hall, to whom
he says he has paid mail, st. 11, and asks
help. Gib Elliot denies the mail, and tells
him to go to the Scotts at Branksome where
he has paid it. Telfer keeps on to Coultart
Cleugh, and there makes his case known to
a brother-in-law, who gives him a mount
“to take the fray” to Catslockhill. There
William’s Wat, who had often eaten of the
Dodhead basket, gives him his company and
that of two sons, and they take the fray to
Branksome. Buccleuch collects a body of
men of his name, and sends them out under
the command of Willie Scott, who overtakes
the marauders, and asks the Captain if he
will let Telfer’s kye go back. This he will
not do for love or for fear. The Scotts set
on them; Willie is killed, but two and thirty
of the raiders’ saddles are emptied, and the
Captain is badly wounded and made prisoner.
Nor is that all, for the Scotts ride to the Captain’s
house and loose his cattle, and when
they come to the Fair Dodhead, for ten milk
kye Jamie Telfer has three and thirty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Walter Scott of Harden and Walter Scott
of Goldielands, and, according to Scott of
Satchells, Scott of Commonside, st. 26, were
engaged with Buccleuch in the rescue of Kinmont
Willie. So was Will Elliot of Gorrombye,
st. 27<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ballad was retouched for the Border
Minstrelsy, nobody can say how much. The
36th stanza is in Hardyknute style. St. 12
is not only found elsewhere (cf. ‘Young
Beichan,’ <b>E</b> 6), but could not be more inappropriately
brought in than here; Scott, however,
is not responsible for that.</p>

<p class='c010'>Scott makes the following notes on the localities:</p>

<p class='c011'>2. Hardhaughswire is the pass from Liddesdale
to the head of Teviotdale. Borthwick
water is a stream which falls into the
Teviot three miles above Hawick. 3. The
Dodhead was in Selkirkshire, near Singlee,
where there are still the vestiges of an old
tower. 7. Stobs Hall: upon Slitterick. 10.
Branksome Ha, the ancient family-seat of the
lairds of Buccleuch, near Hawick. 13. The
Coultart Cleugh is nearly opposite to Carlinrig,
on the road between Hawick and Mosspaul.
26. The estates mentioned in this verse belonged
to families of the name of Scott residing
upon the waters of Borthwick and
Teviot, near the castle of their chief. 27.
The pursuers seem to have taken the road
through the hills of Liddesdale in order to
collect forces and intercept the forayers at
the passage of the Liddel on their return to
Bewcastle. 29. The Frostylee is a brook
which joins the Teviot near Mosspaul. 33,
38. The Ritterford and Kershopeford are
noted fords on the river Liddel. 36. The
Dinlay is a mountain in Liddesdale. 44.
Stanegirthside: a house belonging to the Foresters,
situated on the English side of the
Liddel.</p>

<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, for P. Brooksby, with the variation,
“at the Golden Ball, near the Bear Tavern,
in Pye Corner.” The ballad was given in
Ritson’s Ancient Songs, 1790, p. 192, from
<b>A a</b>, collated with another copy “in the hands
of John Baynes, Esq.” In a note, p. 332,
Ritson says: “In the editor’s collection is a
somewhat different ballad upon the same
subject, intitled ‘Sir Hugh in the Grimes
downfall, or a new song made on Sir Hugh
in the Grime, who was hangd for stealing the
Bishop’s mare.’ It begins, ‘Good Lord John
is a hunting gone.’” This last was evidently
the late and corrupt copy <b>D</b>. Of <b>C</b> Scott
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>says: “The present edition was procured for
me by my friend Mr W. Laidlaw, in Blackhouse,
and has been long current in Selkirkshire.
Mr Ritson’s copy has occasionally
been resorted to for better readings.” <b>B</b> is
partially rewritten by Cunningham, Songs of
Scotland, I, 327. The copy in R. H. Evans’s
Old Ballads, 1810, I, 367, is <b>A</b>; that in The
Ballads and Songs of Ayrshire, First Series,

<p class='c011'>“According to tradition,” says Stenhouse,
“Robert Aldridge, Bishop of Carlisle, about
the year 1560, seduced the wife of Hugh
Graham, one of those bold and predatory
chiefs who so long inhabited what was called
the debateable land on the English and Scottish
border. Graham, being unable to bring
so powerful a prelate to justice, in revenge
made an excursion into Cumberland, and carried
off, <i>inter alia</i>, a fine mare belonging to
the bishop; but being closely pursued by Sir
John Scroope, warden of Carlisle, with a
party on horseback, was apprehended near
Solway Moss, and carried to Carlisle, where
he was tried and convicted of felony. Great
intercessions were made to save his life, but
the bishop, it is said, being determined to remove
the chief obstacle to his guilty passions,
remained inexorable, and poor Graham fell a
victim to his own indiscretion and his wife’s
infidelity. Anthony Wood observes that
there were many changes in this prelate’s
time, both in church and state, but that he
retained his office and preferments during
them all.” Musical Museum, 1853, IV, 297.</p>

<p class='c011'>The pretended tradition is plainly extracted
from the ballad, the bishop’s name and the
date being supplied from without. The <i>inter
alia</i> is introduced, and the mare qualified as
a fine one, to mitigate the ridiculousness of
making Hugh Graham steal a mare to retaliate
the wrong done him by the bishop. As
Allan Cunningham remarks, “tradition, in
all the varieties of her legends, never invented
such an unnecessary and superfluous reason
as this. By habit and by nature thieves, the
Græmes never waited for anything like a pretence
to steal.” In passing, it may be observed
that Hugh is quite arbitrarily elevated
to the rank of a predatory chief.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scott suggested in 1803, Minstrelsy, I, 86 f.,
that Hugh Graham may have been one of
more than four hundred borderers against
whom complaints were exhibited to the lord
bishop of Carlisle for incursions, murders,
burnings, mutilations, and spoils committed
by the English of Cumberland and Westmoreland
upon Scots “presently after the queen’s
departure;” that is, after Mary Stuart’s going
to France, which was in 1548. Nearly a
third of the names given in a partial list are
Grames, but there is no Hugh among them.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
The bishop of Carlisle at the time was Robert
Aldridge, who held the see from 1537 till his
death in 1555.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Lord Scroope (Screw) is
the English warden of the West Marches in
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. A Lord Scroope had that office in
1542, but Lord Wharton, Lord Dacre, and
others during the last years of Bishop Aldridge’s
life, say from 1548 to 1555. Henry
Lord Scroope of Bolton was appointed to the
place in 1563, retained it thirty years, and
was succeeded by his son, Thomas.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Considering
how long the Scroopes held the warden-ship,
and that the ballad is not so old as the
middle of the sixteenth century, the fact that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>a Lord Scroope was not warden in the precise
year when the complaints were addressed
to the bishop of Carlisle would be of no consequence
if Scott’s conjecture were well supported.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story is the same in <b>A-D</b>, and in <b>E</b>
also till we near the end, though there are
variations in the names. The scene is at Carlisle
in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>; at Stirling in <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>. Lord
Home, who appears as intercessor for Hugh
Graham in <b>C</b>, exercises the authority of the
Scottish warden and arrests Hugh in <b>E</b>.
Lord Home was warden of the <i>east</i> marches
of Scotland from 1550, and I know not how
much earlier, to 1564. The Lord Boles of <b>A</b>
may possibly represent Sir Robert Bowes,
who was warden of the <i>east</i> marches of England
in 1550 and earlier. The Whitefoords
of <b>B</b> are adopted into the ballad from the
region in which that version circulated, they
being “an ancient family in Renfrewshire
and Lanarkshire, and latterly in Ayrshire.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The high jump which Hugh makes in <b>A</b>
18, <b>C</b> 12, <b>D</b> 4 (fourteen, or even eighteen,
feet, with his hands tied on his back), is presumably
an effort at escape, though, for all
that is said, it might be a leap in the air. In
<b>E</b> 16–19, the prisoner jumps an eighteen-foot
wall (tied as before), is defended by four
brothers against ten pursuers, and sent over
sea: which is certainly a modern perversion.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A</b> is strangely corrupted in several places,
2<sup>2</sup>, 11<sup>4</sup>, 13<sup>2</sup>. Screw is plainly for Scroope.
Garlard, sometimes printed Garland, is an
obscuration of Cárlisle. The extravagance
in 16<sup>3</sup>, it is to be hoped, is a corruption
also. Stanzas 3, 8 of <b>B</b> are obviously, as
Cromek says, the work of Burns, and the
same is true of 10<sup>3–4</sup>. But Burns has left
some nonsense in 11, 12: ‘my sword that’s
bent in the middle clear,’ ‘my sword that’s
bent in the middle brown.’ We have more
of this meaningless phraseology in <b>E</b> 10, 11,
12, where swords are pointed ‘wi the metal
clear,’ ‘brown,’ ‘fine.’ Stanza 15 of <b>E</b> is borrowed
from ‘Johnie Armstrong.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Boyd, the translator of Dante, had a recollection
of a ballad of a Scotch minstrel who
stole a horse from one of the Henries of England:
Ritson, Scotish Song, I, xxxvi, note 25,
1794.</p>

<p class='c011'>Printed in Scott’s Minstrelsy, 1802 (<b>A c</b>),
and the next year in the Musical Museum
(<b>A b</b>), as communicated by Burns. Burns’s
copy differs very slightly from <b>A a</b>, however
he came by it. Scott had access to the Glenriddell
collection, and his ballad (of which he
gives no account) was made by changing <b>A a</b>
to his taste, substituting one stanza of his own
in place of 18, and the last two of <b>B</b>, with
alterations, for the last of <b>A a</b>. To reduce
improbabilities, Scott put the Lord Warden
for King Henry.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>C</b> was pointed out to me, and transcribed
from the short-lived periodical in which it was
printed, by Mr James Barclay Murdoch, to
whom I have been from the beginning indebted
for the most essential help.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of <b>D</b> Mr Macmath writes: This version
was copied by me in fac-simile from the original
manuscript in the handwriting of the late
Rev. George Murray, of Troquhain, minister
of Balmaclellan, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright,
and was in possession of his son, the
Rev. George Murray, to whose kindness I was
indebted for the loan of it. The late Mr
Murray took down the ballad from the singing
of Sarah Rae, a poor weak-minded woman
of his parish. Sarah Rae was the last person
known to Mr Murray—and he was a keen
observer of such matters—to use the distaff.
The present Mr George Murray wrote to me
on 12th January, 1883: “I may add that I
have heard her sing the ballad myself, to a
very simple but particularly plaintive lilt—more
like a rapid chant than an ordinary song—which
rings in my ear yet, although I only
heard it once, when a lad.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><b>A-C.</b> A harper of Lochmaben (blind, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>)
who means to steal the Wanton Brown, a
horse of King Henry’s, consults with his wife
before setting about the business, and gets a
few valuable hints; among them, to leave his
mare’s foal at home. He goes up to England,
and has the good luck, so common in ballads,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of finding King Henry at his gate. The king
wants to hear some of his harping, and, as the
harper makes a difficulty about the stabling of
his mare, orders the beast to be put into his
own stable. The harper harps all his hearers
asleep; then makes his way softly to the
stable, slips a halter over the Wanton’s nose
and ties him to the mare’s tail, and turns the
mare out. She goes straight to Lochmaben,
to her foal, neighs at the harper’s house, and
is let in by the servant-lass, who exclaims at
the braw foal that the mare has got. In the
morning they find in England that both the
Wanton Brown and the mare have been
stolen. The harper breaks out into ‘allaces:’
he has lost a foal in Scotland and had his
mare stolen in England! The king quiets
him with a promise of a better mare and pay
for his foal to boot.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, the harper steals the horse on a
wager, which, however, is passed over lightly
in <b>D</b>. The wager in <b>E</b> is with two knights of
Stirling, five ploughs of land with one and five
thousand pounds with the other, and “John”
has to go all the way to London to win it.
The knights pay their loss and then restore
the Wanton Brown to Henry!—so great an
improvement upon the dealings of the Scots
with English horseflesh as to compel one to
assign this particular version of the story to
the nineteenth, if not the twentieth, century.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The twelve armed men in armor bright
that guard the stable night and day in <b>E</b> 23
remind us of popular tales; as of the Grimms’
‘Master Thief.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'><b>A.</b> ‘A song of Parcy Reed and the Three False Halls,’
the late Robert White’s papers.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> ‘The Death of Parcy Reed,’ Richardson’s Borderer’s
Table Book, 1846, VII, 361; J. H. Dixon, Ancient
Poems, Ballads and Songs of the Peasantry of
England, p. 99, Percy Society, vol. xvii, 1846.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of <b>B</b>, which purports to have been taken
down from an old woman’s singing by James
Telfer, Mr Robert White, from whom I
received <b>A</b>, said in a letter to Mr J. H.
Dixon: “Parcy Reed, as you suspect, is not
genuine, for it bears marks of our friend’s improvements.
I have a copy of the original
somewhere, but may not be able to find it.”
And again, Telfer himself, “in a letter to the
late Robert Storey, the Northumbrian poet,”
wrote, “I will send Mr Dixon the real verses,
but it is but a droll of a ballad.” (J. H.
Dixon, in Notes and Queries, Fourth Series,
I, 108, V, 520.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Comparison will show that almost the whole
of <b>A</b> is preserved in <b>B</b>, and in fairly good form.
<b>B</b> has also some stanzas not found in <b>A</b> which
may be accepted as traditional. Telfer may
have added a dozen of his own, and has retouched
others.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr White, after remarking that there is
no historical evidence to show when the event
on which the ballad was founded occurred, informs
us that almost every circumstance in the
narrative has been transmitted to the present
century by local tradition.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Percival, or Parcy, Reed,” in the words of
Mr White, “was proprietor of Troughend,
an elevated tract of land lying on the west
side and nearly in the centre of Redesdale,
Northumberland. The remains of the old
tower may still be seen, a little to the west of
the present mansion, commanding a beautiful
and most extensive view of nearly the whole
valley. Here he resided, and being a keen
hunter and brave soldier, he possessed much
influence, and was appointed warden or keeper
of the district. His office was to suppress
and order the apprehension of thieves and
other breakers of the law; in the execution of
which he incurred the displeasure of a family
of brothers of the name of Hall, who were
owners of Girsonsfield, a farm about two
miles east from Troughend. He also drew
upon himself the hostility of a band of moss-troopers,
Crosier by name, some of whom he
had been successful in bringing to justice.
The former were, however, artful enough to
conceal their resentment, and under the appearance
of friendship calmly awaited an
opportunity to be avenged. Some time afterwards,
they solicited his attendance on a hunting
expedition to the head of Redesdale, and
unfortunately he agreed to accompany them.
His wife had some strange dreams anent his
safety on the night before his departure, and
at breakfast, on the following morning, the
loaf of bread from which he was supplied
chanced to be turned with the bottom upwards,
an omen which is still accounted most
unfavorable all over the north of England.
Considering these presages undeserving of notice,
Reed set out in company with the Halls,
and, after enjoying a good day’s sport, the
party withdrew to a solitary hut in Batinghope,
a lonely glen stretching westward from
the Whitelee, whose little stream forms one
of the chief sources of Reedwater. The whole
of this arrangement had been previously
planned by the Halls and Crosiers, and when
the latter came down, late in the evening, to execute
their purpose of vengeance, they found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Parcy Reed altogether a defenceless man.
His companions not only deserted him, but
had previously driven his sword so firmly in
its scabbard that it could not be drawn, and
had also moistened the powder with which
the very long gun he carried with him was
charged, so as to render both useless when he
came to rely upon them for protection. Accordingly
the Crosiers instantly put him to
death; and so far did they carry out their
sanguinary measures, even against his lifeless
body, that tradition says the fragments thereof
had to be collected together and conveyed in
pillow-slips home to Troughend. Public indignation
was speedily aroused against the
murderers; the very name of Crosier was abhorred
throughout Redesdale, and the abettors
were both driven from their residence and designated
as the fause-hearted Ha’s, an appellation
which yet remains in force against
them.” (Richardson’s Borderer’s Table Book,
VII, 361.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The farm of Girsonsfield, according to the
ballad, <b>A</b> 3, 18, belonged to the Halls. But
that place has been the property of others,
says Mr White, “ever since the reign of Elizabeth;”
whence he concludes that the story
is not to be dated later than the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c011'>Parcy Reed is famed to have had a favorite
dog named Keeldar, and, though a “peerless
archer,” to have killed him by an unlucky
shot while hunting. Sir Walter Scott has
celebrated this mishap and its consequence in
‘The Death of Keeldar’ (Table Book, as
above, p. 240); and he alludes to the treacherous
murder of Reed (with which he became
acquainted through Robert Roxby’s ‘Lay of
the Reedwater Minstrel,’ 1809) in Rokeby,
written in 1812, Canto I, xx.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'><b>A.</b> ‘The Laird of Waristoun,’ Jamieson’s Popular Ballads,
I, 109.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> ‘Laird of Wariestoun,’ Kinloch MSS, VII, 217; Kinloch’s
Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 49.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>C.</b> ‘Death of Lord Warriston,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the
North of Scotland, I, 56.</p>

<p class='c010'>Birrell’s Diary, under the date of July
2, 1600, has the following entry: “John Kinland
[Kincaid] of Waristone murderit be hes
awin wyff and servant-man, and the nurische
being also upone the conspiracy. The said
gentilwoman being apprehendit, scho was tane
to the Girth Crosse upon the 5 day of Julii,
and her heid struck fra her bodie at the Can-nagait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>fit; quha diet verie patiently. Her
nurische was brunt at the same tyme, at 4
houres in the morneing, the 5 of Julii.” P. 49.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both husband and wife belonged to houses
of some note. The wife, Jean Livingston,
was a daughter of John Livingston of Dunipace,
“and related to many of the first families
in Scotland.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing seems to have been done to keep
the murder from divulging. Warriston being
only about a mile from Edinburgh, information
very soon reached the authorities of justice,
and those who were found in the house,
the mistress, the nurse, and two female servants,
were arrested. The crime was committed
on Tuesday morning, not long after
midnight. On Thursday such trial as there
was took place, and it may have occupied
three hours, probably less. At three o’clock
on Saturday morning sentence was executed.
This had been burning (<i>i. e.</i> after strangling),
both for the principal and her accomplice, the
nurse; but for the well-born woman, no doubt
through the influence of her kindred, it was
commuted to beheading. The servant-man
who did the handiwork fled, but the penalty
for undue devotion to his former master’s
daughter overtook him within four years. He
was broken on a cart-wheel with a plough-coulter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The judicial records in the case of Jean
Livingston are lost, but the process of the
murder and the provocation are known from a
register of the trial of Robert Weir, the actual
perpetrator, and partly also from Jean Livingston’s
own relation. Jean Livingston, having
conceived a deadly hatred and malice against
her husband, John Kincaid, “for the alleged
biting of her in the arm and striking her divers
times,” sent word by her nurse, Janet Murdo,
to Robert Weir, formerly servant to her father,
to come to Wariston to speak with her concerning
the murdering of him. The nurse,
who, we may safely suppose, had been the
witness of Kincaid’s brutal behavior, was no
unwilling agent. “She helped me too well
in mine evil purpose,” says her mistress; “for
when I told her what I was minded to do, she
consented to the doing of it, and&nbsp;... when I
sent her to seek the man who would do it, she
said, I shall go and seek him, and if I get him
not, I shall seek another; and if I get none, I
shall do it myself.” This the nurse confessed.
The other two women knew nothing of the
deed before it was done; “and that which they
knew,” says the mistress again, “they durst
not tell for fear, for I had compelled them to
dissemble.” Robert Weir, having given consent,
was put in a cellar, where he stayed till
midnight, about which time he came up and
went to Kincaid’s chamber. Kincaid, who
had waked with the “din,” and was leaning
over the side of his bed, was knocked to the
floor by a blow in the neck, kicked in the
belly, and then throttled. “As soon as that
man gripped him and began his evil turn,”
says the wife, “so soon as my husband cried
so fearfully, I leapt outover my bed and went
to the hall, where I sat all the time till that
unhappy man came to me and reported that
mine husband was dead.” She desired Weir,
she says, to take her away with him, for
she feared trial, albeit flesh and blood made
her think that her father’s interest at court
would have saved her (this may have been an
after-thought). But Weir refused, saying, You
shall tarry still, and if this matter come not
to light, you shall say he died in the gallery,
and I shall return to my master’s service.
But if it be known, I shall fly and take the
crime on me, and none dare pursue you.</p>

<p class='c011'>A benevolent minister, who visited Jean
Livingston in prison about ten o’clock on
Thursday, the third day after the murder,
found her “raging in a senseless fury, disdainfully
taunting every word of grace that was
spoken to her, impatiently tearing her hair,
sometimes running up and down the house
like one possessed, sometimes throwing herself
on the bed and sprawling, refusing all
comfort by word, and, when the book of God
was brought to her, flinging it upon the walls,
twice or thrice, most unreverently.” His
warnings of wrath to come and his exhortations
to seek mercy through repentance were
treated as “trittle, trattle,” and she stubbornly
refused to pray for herself, or to take
part in his prayer, or to say so much as God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>help me. He told her that she was promising
herself impunity, but within a few hours,
when she should have the sentence of death
pronounced against her, the pride of her heart
would be broken. The trial and sentence
followed hard upon this, and when the minister
returned, some time in the afternoon, he
found a visible and apparent grace beginning
in her. He remained with her till after midnight,
and when he left her, Jean Livingston
could say that she felt in her heart a free remission
of all her sins. This worthy man
came to the prison again early the next morning,
and found God’s grace wonderfully augmented
in her. She was full of joy and courage.
Those that stood about her said they
never saw her so amiable or well-favored.
The glory of God was shining both without
and within her.</p>

<p class='c011'>To follow no further this astounding chapter
in psychology, this bairn of twenty-one
years,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a> with whom the Lord began to work in
mercy upon Thursday at two hours in the
afternoon, gave up her soul to him in peace
upon the Saturday following at three hours in
the morning. “When she came to the scaffold
and was carried up upon it, she looked up to
the Maiden with two longsome looks,” but
her serenity was not disturbed. She made a
confession at each of the four corners of the
scaffold, took “good night” cheerfully of all
her friends, kissing them, and then, “as a
constant saint of God, humbled herself on her
knees and offered her neck to the axe.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It may be gathered from Weir’s indictment
that it was the ill treatment which she had received
from her husband that incited the wife
to the murder. Two of the ballads, <b>A</b> 4, <b>B</b> 2,
make the same representation. An epitaph
on Jean Livingston gives us to understand that
both parties were very young, and were married
aganst their will (invita invito subjuncta
puella puello): whence perpetual disagreements
(nihil in thalamo nisi rixæ, jurgia,
lites).</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, the strangling is done by the
nurse and her lady, Man’s Enemy personally
knotting the tether in <b>A</b>; in <b>C</b> it is done by
the nurse alone. In <b>B</b> 8 the great Dunipace,
in his anger at hearing what his daughter has
done, cries out for her to be put in a barrel of
pikes<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a> and rolled down some lea. In <b>C</b> the
father, mother, and brother come to see Jean,
and would fain give everything to borrow her.
This is a by much too flattering account of
the behavior of her relatives, who were principally
anxious to have her got out of the
world with as little éclat as might be. None
of them came near her in prison, though
Wariston’s brother did. <b>C</b> makes Wariston’s
mortal offence not the throwing a plate at her
face (<b>A</b>) or striking her on the mouth (<b>B</b>),
but the taxing her with a bairn by another
man.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c017'><sup>[13]</sup></a> The unfriendly relations of the pair
must have been notorious. In the prison the
wife “purged herself very sincerely from many
scandalous things she had been bruited with.
Not that she would excuse herself that she
was a sinner in the highest rank, but that
she might clear herself from these false reports

</div>

<p class='c021'><b>A.</b> ‘Lord Maxwell’s Last Goodnight,’ communicated
to Percy by G. Paton, 1778.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> ‘Lord Maxwell’s Goodnight,’ Glenriddell MSS, XI,
18, 1791, Scott’s Minstrelsy, I, 194, 1802; II, 133,
1833.</p>

<p class='c010'>First published in the Minstrelsy of the
Scottish Border, “from a copy in Glenriddell’s
MS., with some slight variations from tradition.”
I understand this to mean, not
that the variations were derived from tradition,
but that the text of the Minstrelsy departs
somewhat from that of the manuscript.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A</b> and <b>B</b> agree entirely as to matter. The
order of the stanzas, not being governed by
an explicit story, might be expected to vary
with every reciter.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the year 1585, John, Lord Maxwell, having
incurred the enmity of the king’s favorite,
the Earl of Arran, was denounced rebel, on
such charges as were always at hand, and a
commission was given to the Laird of Johnstone
to pursue and take him. A hired force,
by the aid of which this was expected to be
done, was badly routed by the Maxwells in
a sharp fight. Johnstone made a raid on
Maxwell’s lands; Maxwell burnt Johnstone’s
house. Finally, in one of their skirmishes,
Johnstone was captured: “the grief of this
overthrow gave Johnstone, shortly after he
was liberated, his death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After some years of feud, the two chiefs, “by
the industry of certain wise gentlemen of the
Johnstones,” surprised all Scotland by making
a treaty of peace. On April 1, 1592, they
entered into a bond to forget and forgive all
rancor and malice of the past, and to live in
amity, themselves and their friends, in all
time coming. A little more than a year after,
a party of Johnstones, relying, no doubt, on the
forbearance of their new ally, then warden of
the West Marches, “rode a stealing” in the
lands of Lord Sanquhar and of the knights of
Drumlanrig, Lag, and Closeburn, carried off a
large booty, and killed eighteen men who endeavored
to retrieve their property. (See No
184, ‘The Lads of Wamphray.’) The injured
gentlemen made complaint to Maxwell as
warden, and also procured a commission directing
him to proceed against the Johnstones.
Maxwell was in an awkward plight. To induce
him to take action, several of the sufferers
engaged to enter into a bond of manrent,
or homage, to Maxwell, by which they should
be obliged to service and he to protection.
“Maxwell, thinking this to be a good occasion
for bringing all Nithsdale to depend upon him,
embraced the offer.” But this bond, through
negligence, came to the hands of Johnstone,
who, seeing what turn matters would take,
made a league with Scotts, Eliots, and others,
and in a battle at Dryfe Sands, by superior
strategy, defeated Maxwell, though the warden
had much larger numbers. This was in
December, 1593. “The Lord Maxwell, a tall
man and heavy in armor, was in the chase
overtaken and stricken from his horse. The
report went that he called to Johnstone and
desired to be taken as he had sometime taken
his father, but was unmercifully used, and
the hand that he reached forth cut off. But
of this,” says Spotiswood, “I can affirm nothing.
There always the Lord Maxwell fell,
having received many wounds.” Drumlanrig,
Closeburn, and other of the Nithsdale
lairds of Maxwell’s faction, barely escaped
with their lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir James Johnstone soon made his peace
with the king, whose warden had been slain
while acting under royal authority. The heir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of the slain warden, John, the ninth Lord
Maxwell, is said to have been only eight years
old at the time of his father’s death.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a> If this
was so, he became very early of age for all
purposes of offence. The two clans kept up
a bloody and destructive private war. Both
chiefs were imprisoned and proclaimed rebel or
traitor; Maxwell twice, first in 1601, as favoring
popery, and again in 1607, for his extravagant
turbulence; and in each case he
made his own escape, the second time by the
use of violence. At length, influenced perhaps
by a conviction that his defiance of the
law had gone too far for his safety, Maxwell
seemed to be seriously disposed to reconcile
himself with his inveterate enemy.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Sir James
Johnstone, as it happened, had already asked
Sir Robert Maxwell, who was his brother-in-law
and cousin to Lord Maxwell, to speak to
his kinsman with that view. Sir Robert had
no wish to meddle, for his cousin, he said, was
a dangerous man to have to do with. Lord
John, however, spontaneously sent for Sir
Robert, and said to him, You see my estate
and the danger I stand in. I would crave
your counsel as a man that tenders my weal.
The result of much conference and writing
(in which Sir Robert Maxwell, evidently feeling
imperfect confidence in his cousin, acted
with great caution) was that Lord Maxwell
proposed a tryst with Sir James Johnstone,
each of them to be accompanied by one person
only, and no others to be present except
Sir Robert, and faithfully promised, with his
hands between Sir Robert’s hands, that neither
he nor the man he should bring with him
should do any wrong, “whether they agreed
or not.” Johnstone accepted the terms and
made corresponding promises. The meeting
came off the 6th of April, 1608. Johnstone
brought Willie Johnstone with him, and Maxwell
Charlie Maxwell, a man that Sir Robert
strongly disapproved, but his chief undertook
to be answerable for him. Sir Robert required
the same guaranty on the part of Johnstone
for his follower, and these men were ordered to
keep away from one another. The two principals
and their mediator between them rode off,
with their backs to their men, and began their
parley. Looking round, Sir Robert saw that
Charlie Maxwell had left his appointed place
and gone to Willie Johnstone, at whom, after
some words between them, he fired a pistol.
Sir Robert cried to Lord Maxwell, Fie, make
not yourself a traitor and me both! Lord
Maxwell replied, I am blameless. Sir James
Johnstone slipped away to see to his follower’s
safety. Lord Maxwell followed Sir James,
shot him in the back, and rode off.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Maxwell fled the country, but was
tried in his absence and sentenced to death,
with forfeiture of his estates. He came back
to Scotland after four years, was basely betrayed
into the power of the government by
a kinsman, and was beheaded at Edinburgh
May 21, 1613.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus was finally ended,” remarks Sir
Walter Scott, “by a salutary example of severity,
the ‘foul debate’ betwixt the Maxwells
and Johnstones, in the course of which
each family lost two chieftains: one dying of
a broken heart, one in the field of battle, one
by assassination, and one by the sword of the
executioner.”</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A</b> 1, 2, and <i>passim</i>. The very affectionate
relations of Lord Maxwell and his ‘lady and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>only joy,’ are a fiction of the ballad-maker.
His wife was daughter of the first Marquis
of Hamilton. Maxwell instituted a process
of divorce against her, and she died while this
was pending, before he fled the country in
1608. By his treatment of his wife he made
her brother, the second marquis, and the Hamiltons
generally, his enemies.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c017'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>5, 6. Carlaverock castle had from far back
belonged to the Maxwells, and is theirs still.
They had a house, or castle, at Dumfries, and
the custody of the “houses” of Lochmaben,
Langholm, and Thrieve.</p>

<p class='c011'>9, 10. Douglas of Drumlanrig, Kirkpatrick
of Closeburn, and Grierson of Lag fled
in the <i>sauve qui peut</i> of Dryfe Sands, and the
partisans of Lord Maxwell, who there lost
his life, would naturally describe them as deserting
their chief. They (or two of them)
had entered into a “band” with Maxwell, as
aforesaid. The ballad-maker seems to intimate
that they were in a band with each other,
or with somebody, to betray Maxwell.</p>

<p class='c011'>11, and <b>B</b> 1. ‘Robin in the Orchet,’ ‘Robert
of Oarchyardtoan,’ is properly Sir Robert
Maxwell of Orchardton, Lord John’s cousin,
but it is evident, from the conjunction of mother
and sisters, that the person here intended
is his brother Robert, to whom, some years
after the execution and forfeiture of Lord
John, the estates were restored.</p>

<p class='c011'>14. Maxwell’s wife, as said above, was no
longer living. The “offers” which he made,
to save his life, contain a proposal that he
should marry the slain Sir James Johnstone’s
daughter, without any dowry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Goodnight” is to be taken loosely as a
farewell. Other cases are ‘John Armstrong’s
last Goodnight,’ and the well-known beautiful
fragment (?) of two stanzas called ‘Armstrong’s
Goodnight;’ again, Essex’s last Goodnight,
to the tune of The King’s last Goodnight,
Chappell, Roxburghe Ballads, I, 570,
and Popular Music, p. 174. The Earl of Derby
sings a Goodnight (though the name is not
used) in ‘Flodden Field,’ No 168, III, 356,
stanzas 36–58. Justice Shallow sang those
tunes that he heard the carmen whistle, and
sware they were his Fancies, or his Good-nights:
Second Part of Henry IV, III, 2.
Lord Byron, in the preface to Childe Harold’s
Pilgrimage, says “the good-night in the
beginning of the first canto was suggested
by Lord Maxwell’s Goodnight in the Border
Minstrelsy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Undoubtedly these stanzas may have occurred

<p class='c011'>The modern, and extremely vapid, ballad
of ‘Frennet Hall’ appeared originally (I suppose)
in Herd’s Scottish Songs, 1776, I, 142,
and was afterwards received into Ritson’s
Scotish Songs, II, 31, The Musical Museum,
No 286, etc.</p>

<p class='c010'>James Crichton of Frendraught and William
Gordon of Rothiemay (a neighboring
estate<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a>) had a fierce quarrel about fishing-rights
pertaining to lands which Gordon had
sold to Crichton. A legal decision was rendered
in favor of Frendraught, who, however,
pursued his adversary with excessive
vigor and procured him to be outlawed.
After this, Rothiemay would hear to no
terms of peace, and collected a party of loose
fellows with the intent to waste Frendraught’s
lands. Frendraught obtained a commission
to arrest Rothiemay, and on the first
day of the year 1630 set out to put this in
force, accompanied, among others, by his uncle
(George Gordon) James Leslie, son of the
laird of Pitcaple, and John Meldrum, who was
married to young Leslie’s aunt. Rothiemay,
hearing of Frendraught’s coming, rode out to
meet him, and there was a fight, in which
Rothiemay and George Gordon were mortally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>wounded, and Meldrum badly. The feud
waxed hot, and Frendraught’s lands were in
danger of being burned and ravaged by Highlanders,
with whom John Gordon of Rothiemay,
son to the slain laird, had combined for
the purpose. But in the end, by the strenuous
exertions of the Marquis of Huntly and
others, a settlement was effected. The laird
of Rothiemay and the children of George Gordon
were “to remit their father’s slaughter
mutually,” and in satisfaction thereof the
laird of Frendraught was to pay a certain
sum of money to young Rothiemay and to
George Gordon’s children: “which both,
Frendraught obeyed and performed willingly,
and so, all parties having shaken hands, they
were heartily reconciled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This broil was no sooner settled than another
sprouted, a side-shoot from the same
stem. Meldrum, who had been with Frendraught
in the affray with Rothiemay, and had
been wounded, was dissatisfied with such requital
as he received, and, getting nothing
more by his bickering and threats, helped
himself one night to two of Frendraught’s
best horses. Summoned to court for the theft,
he “turned rebel” and did not appear. Frendraught
obtained a commission to arrest him,
and went to look for him at Pitcaple, a place
belonging to John Leslie, Meldrum’s brother-in-law.
He did not find Meldrum, but fell
in with James Leslie, Pitcaple’s son, who
had also been of Frendraught’s party at the
encounter on New Year’s day. There was
talk about Meldrum’s behavior, in which
Frendraught comported himself forbearingly;
but James Leslie and Robert Crichton, a
kinsman of Frendraught, had hot words,
which ended in Leslie’s getting a dangerous
shot in the arm. Hereupon the larger part
of the surname of Leslie rose in arms against
the Crichtons. Frendraught, grieved for
what had happened to James Leslie, betook
himself to the Marquis of Huntly, and entreated
him to make peace. The marquis
sent for the Leslies, and did his best to reconcile
them, but Pitcaple would listen to nothing
until he knew whether his son James
was to live or die. Huntly, fearing for Frendraught’s
safety, kept him two days at the Bog
of Gight, and then, hearing that the Leslies
were lying in wait, sent his own son, Viscount
Melgum, and the young laird of Rothiemay,
to protect him on the way home.
Arrived there, the laird and his lady begged
these young gentlemen to remain overnight,
“and did their best, with all demonstration
of love and kindness, to entertain them, thinking
themselves happy now to have purchased
such friends who had formerly been their
foes.” At about two in the morning the tower
of Frendraught house, in which these guests
lay, took fire, and they with four of their servants
were burnt to death. This occurred on
the eighth (ninth) of October.</p>

<p class='c011'>So far Sir Robert Gordon, uncle of the lady
of Frendraught and cousin of the Marquis of
Huntly, who was perfectly acquainted with all
the parties and circumstances. He goes on to
say, with entire fairness: “The rumor of this
unhappy accident did speedily spread itself
throughout the whole kingdom, every man
bewailing it, and constructing it diversly as
their affections led them; some laying an
aspersion upon Frendraught, as if he had wilfully
destroyed his guests, who had come
thither to defend him against his enemies;
which carried no appearance of truth; for,
besides the improbability of the matter, he
did lose therein a great quantity of silver,
both coined and uncoined, and likewise all his
writs and evidents were therein burnt.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c017'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The monstrous wickedness of this act would
not, in the light of the history of those times,
afford an argument that would of itself avail
to clear Frendraught; but what words could
describe his recklessness and folly! Supposing
him willing to set fire to his own house,
and sacrifice his silver and securities, for the
gratification of burning young Rothiemay with
the rest, he knew very well what consequences
he had to expect. He had been glad to compound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>his feud with the Rothiemays by the
payment of money (some say the considerable
sum of 50,000 merks). He had been alarmed,
and with good reason, at the prospect of a
feud with the Leslies. But what were these to
a feud with the Marquis of Huntly, which
would bring down upon him, and did bring
down upon him, not only the reprisals of the
Gordons, but spoliation from all the brigands
of the country?<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c017'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>says Chaucer, and so it was with ballad-makers,
and sometimes even with clerks; John
Spalding, for instance, the other contemporary
authority upon this subject, who gives a lively
and detailed account of the burning of the
tower, as follows.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c017'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“The viscount was laid in a bed in the Old
Tower, going off the hall, and standing upon a
vault, wherein there was a round hole, devised
of old, just under Aboyne’s<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c017'><sup>[23]</sup></a> bed. Robert
Gordon, born in Sutherland, his servitor, and
English Will, his page, was both laid beside
him in the same chamber. The laird of Rothiemay,
with some servants beside him, was
laid in an upper chamber just above
Aboyne’s chamber; and in another room
above that chamber was laid George Chalmer
of Noth, and George Gordon, another of the
viscount’s servants; with whom also was laid
Captain Rollok, then in Frendraught’s own
company. Thus all being at rest, about midnight
that dolorous tower took fire in so sudden
and furious manner, yea, and in a clap,
that this noble viscount, the laird of Rothiemay,
English Will, Colin Ivat, another of
Aboyne’s servitors, and other two, being six
in number, were cruelly burnt and tormented
to the death, but help or relief; the laird
of Frendraught, his lady and whole household
looking on, without moving or stirring
to deliver them from the fury of this fearful
fire, as was reported. Robert Gordon, called
Sutherland Robert, being in the viscount’s
chamber, escaped this fire with his life.
George Chalmer and Captain Rollok, being
in the third room, escaped also this fire, and,
as was said, Aboyne might have saved himself
also if he had gone out of doors, which he
would not do, but suddenly ran up stairs to
Rothiemay’s chamber, and wakened him to
rise, and as he is wakening him, the timber
passage and lofting of the chamber hastily
takes fire, so that none of them could win
down stairs again; so they turned to a window
looking to the close, where they piteously
cried help, help, many times, for God’s cause!
the laird and the lady, with their servants,
all seeing and hearing this woeful crying, but
made no help nor manner of helping;<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c017'><sup>[24]</sup></a> which
they perceiving, they cried oftentimes mercy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>at God’s hands for their sins, syne clasped in
other arms, and cheerfully suffered this cruel
martyrdom. Thus died this noble viscount,
of singular expectation, Rothiemay, a brave
youth, and the rest, by this doleful fire never
enough to be deplored, to the great grief and
sorrow of their kin, friends, parents, and whole
country people, especially to the noble marquis,
who for his goodwill got this reward.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spalding tells us that it was reported that,
the morning after the fire, Lady Frendraught,
riding on a small nag, and with no attendants
but a boy to lead her horse, came weeping
to the Bog, desiring to speak with the
marquis, but was refused. The Huntly-Gordons,
the Earl of Errol (brother of Viscountess
Melgum), and many other friends
held a council, and after serious consideration
came to the conclusion that the fire “could not
come by chance, sloth, or accident, but was
plotted and devised of set purpose;” Frendraught,
his lady, his friends and servants, one
or other, knowing thereof. The marquis,
however, was resolved not to revenge himself
“by way of deed,” but to invoke the laws.
Frendraught, as far as we can see, desired a
legal inquiry no less than Huntly. He addressed
himself to the Lord Chancellor and to
the Privy Council, and offered to undergo any
form of trial, and, delays occurring, he repeated
to the Council his wish to have “that
hidden mystery brought to a clear light.”
Examinations and prosecutions, extended to
the middle of the year 1634, failed to fix the
guilt of the fire on him or anybody, although
John Meldrum, on the strength of some
threats which he had uttered, was wrongfully
convicted of the act and was executed.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c017'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><b>A.</b> The date is the eighteenth of October,
new style for the eighth. When Gordon and
Rothiemay (having convoyed Frendraught
safely home) are on the point of returning,
Lady Frendraught urges them to stay, in token
of good feeling between Huntly and her husband.
Lord John is quite disposed to comply,
but Rothiemay says that his horse has been
tampered with since their coming, and he fears
that he is fey. After the regular evening-mass
of ballads (which would have suited
Lady Frendraught, a concealed Catholic, but
not her husband), Lord John and Rothiemay
are laid in one chamber, an arrangement which
would have allowed both to escape, as Robert
Gordon did, who slept in his master’s room.
Lord John wakes with the smoke and heat, and
rouses Rothiemay. The doors and windows
are fastened. Rothiemay goes to the ‘wire-window,’
and finds the stanchions too strong
to be dealt with. He sees Lady Frendraught
below, and cries to her for mercy; her husband
killed the father, and now she is burning
the son. Lady Frendraught is sorry that she
must burn Lord John in order to burn Rothiemay,
but there is no help; the keys are cast
in the deep draw-well.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c017'><sup>[26]</sup></a> [Robert] Gordon,
who has escaped though the keys were in the
well, calls to his master to jump from the
window; he will catch him in his arms. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>master answers that no fire shall part him and
Rothiemay, and besides, the window is fast.
He throws his finger-rings down, to be given
to his lady. When the servant goes home to
his mistress, she reproaches him for coming
back alive and leaving his master dead. She
tears off the clothes which her maid puts on
her, exclaiming that she won a sore heart the
day she was married, and that that day has returned
(which is not easy to understand: see
Appendix).</p>

<p class='c011'><b>B.</b> This fragment represents Lady Frendraught
as being very importunate with Lord
John: she presses him three times over to
stay, and promises him a morning-gift of
lands if he will comply; by a perversion of
tradition, Strathbogie, which had been in his
family three hundred years, and which,
further on, he offers to give her if she will let
him out.  Finding that he cannot escape
(perhaps stanza 7 should come later), Lord
John takes out his psalm-book and sings three
verses, with ‘God end our misery’ at each
verse’s end. In 9 he sees his elder brother,
Lord George, from the window, and asks
what news he has, but a defect conceals from
us the point of this passage.  Stanza 16
seems to belong to Lord John’s wife.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>C.</b> When the gentlemen are in their saddles,
ready to ride away, Lady Frendraught,
on her bare knees, begs them to remain, and
promises them a firlot of red gold if they will.
When everybody has gone to bed, the doors
are locked and the windows shut. The reek
begins to rise and the joists to crack; Lord
John betakes himself to the window, and
finds the stanchions too strong to break. He
goes back and wakens Rothiemay, and proposes
to him to praise the Lord in the fifty-third
psalm,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c017'><sup>[27]</sup></a> for there is treason about them.
He calls to Lady Frendraught, walking on
the green, for mercy; she replies that the
keys are in the well, and the doors were locked
yesterday. He reproaches her for burning her
own flesh. George Chalmers (who really
escaped, though lodged in the third story) is
described as leaping the ditches and coming,
from without, to Rothiemay’s help, and Colin
Irving (the Colin Ivat of Spalding, who was
burnt) as doing the same in behalf of Lord
John, to whom he calls to jump into his
arms. Lord John is burning, and there is
little more left of him than his spirit; but he
throws down a purse of gold for the poor and
his rings for his wife. Lady Rothiemay comes
in the morning to cry vengeance on Frendraught,
who has betrayed the gay Gordons,
killed her lord, and burnt her son.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c017'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><b>D.</b> “‘There are some intermediate particulars,’
Mr Boyd says, ‘respecting the lady’s
lodging her victims in a turret or flanker which
did not communicate with the castle.’ ‘This,’
adds he, ‘I only have from tradition, as I
never heard any other stanzas besides the
foregoing.’ The author of the original, we
may perceive, either through ignorance or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>design, had deviated from the fact in supposing
Lady Frennet’s husband to have been slain
by Lord John’s father.” Ritson, p. 36.@</p>

<p class='c011'>It may be noted that three of the most
tragical of the Scottish historical ballads are
associated with the name of Gordon: the
Burning of Towie, as we might call ‘Captain
Car,’ No 178, through Adam Gordon, uncle
of the first marquis of Huntly; the Burning
of Donibristle, known as ‘The Bonny Earl
of Murray,’ No 181, of which the responsibility
is put upon the marquis (then earl) himself;
and the Burning of Frendraught, in which his
son perished.</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr Sutherland wrote: This fragment I took
down from the recitation of my mother, twenty or
twenty-five years ago. She was born in 1790, and
her great-grandmother was a servant of the last
Forbes of Tolquhon. She had a tradition that
Sophia Hay was one of the Errol family, and married
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Lord John Gordon, who was burned at Frendraught.
Mr Clyne remarked: The Young Tolquhon
at the time of this marriage, about 1628, was
Alexander Forbes, eldest son of William Forbes of
Tolquhon. Alexander is recorded to have died
without issue, and the following additional particulars,
singularly suggestive of a determination on the
unfortunate lover’s part to renounce the world, have
been communicated to me by Dr John Stuart. In
1631 William Forbes granted a charter of the
lands of Tolquhon to his second son Walter and his
heirs male, and in 1632 another deed of the same
sort to Walter, with the express consent of Alexander,
his elder brother. In 1641 Alexander is supposed
to have been dead, as Walter is then styled
“of Tolquhon.” The lady’s somewhat enigmatical
exclamation,</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr Clyne did not fail to observe that Father
Blakhal has recorded of Lady Melgum that he had
often heard her say that she had never loved anybody
but her husband, and never would love
another (Narration, p. 92). This testimony, if not
decisive, may be considered not less cogent as to
the matter of fact than anything in ‘Young Tolquhon’
to the contrary. But it may be that stanza
24 became attached to the Frendraught ballad in
consequence of the coexistence of this or some similar
ballad of Young Tolquhon.</p>

    <div>Motherwelll’s<a id='t49'></a>  MS., p. 470, communicated apparently by Buchan; ‘The Gordons and the Grants,’ Buchan’s Ballads</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c032'>of the North of Scotland, II, 220.</p>

<p class='c033'>There was an implacable feud between
the Grants of Ballindalloch and the Grants
of Carron, “for divers ages,” Sir Robert
Gordon says, certainly for ninety years after
1550. This fragment has to do with the later
stage of their enmity. In 1628, John Grant
of Ballindalloch killed John Grant of Carron.
James Grant of Carron, uncle of the slain
man, burnt all the corn, barns, and byres of
Ballindalloch young and old, and took to the
hills (1630). The Ballindallocbs complained
to Murray, the lieutenant, and he, “to gar
ane devil ding another,” set the Clanchattan
upon James Grant. They laid siege to a
house where he was with a party of his men;
he made his way out, was pursued, and was
taken after receiving eleven arrow-wounds.
When he was well enough to travel, he was
sent to Edinburgh, and, as everybody supposed,
to his death; but after a confinement
of more than a year he broke ward (October,
1632). Large sums were offered for him, alive
or dead; but James Grant was hard to keep
and hard to catch, and in November, 1633,
he began to kythe again in the north. A
gang of the forbidden name of McGregor,
who had been brought into the country by Ballindalloch
to act against James Grant, beset
him in a small house in Carron where he was
visiting his wife, having only his son and one
other man with him; but he defended himself
with the spirit of another Cloudesly, shot
the captain, and got off to the bog with his
men.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c017'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c034'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“The year of God one thousand six hundred
thirty-six, some of the Marquis of Huntly’s
followers and servants did invade the
rebel James Grant and some of his associates,
hard by Strathbogy. They burnt the house
wherein he was, but, the night being dark and
windy, he and his brother, Robert Grant, escaped.”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c017'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c034'>This last escapade of James Grant may
perhaps be the one to which this fragment has
reference, though Ballindalloch was not personally
engaged in the assault on the house,
and I know of no Douglas having sheltered
Grant of Carron. One almost wonders that
this mettlesome and shifty outlaw was not
celebrated in a string of ballads.</p>

<p class='c034'>Early in 1639, James Grant got his peace
from the king; later in the year, he joined
the “barons” at Aberdeen with five hundred
men, and in 1640, we are told, “he purchased
his remission orderly and went home to his
own country peaceably (against all men’s expectation,
being such a blood-shedder and
cruel oppressor) after he had escaped so many
dangers.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c017'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

the North of Scotland, II, 136.</p>

<p class='c010'>Buchan had another copy, sent him in
manuscript by a young lady in Aberdeen, in
which the Earl Marischal was made prominent:
Ballads, II, 321. Aytoun, I, 139, had
a copy which had been annotated by C. K.
Sharpe, and from this he seems to have derived
a few variations. The New Deeside
Guide [1832], p. 5 (nominally by James
Brown, but written by Dr Joseph Robertson),
gives <b>A</b>, with a few trifling improvements
which seem to be editorial.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A, B, 1–8.</b> The ballad is accurate as to the
date, not commonly a good sign for such
things. On Tuesday, the eighteenth of June,
1639, Montrose began an attack on the bridge
of Dee, which had been fortified and manned
by the royalists of Aberdeen to stop his advance
on the city. The bridge was bravely
defended that day and part of the next by
Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston (not Middleton;
Middleton was of the assailants). The
young Lord of Aboyne, just made the king’s
lieutenant in the north, had a small body of
horse on the north side of the river. Montrose’s
cavalry were sent up the south side as
if to cross (though there was no ford), and
Aboyne’s were moved along the opposite
bank to resist a passage. This exposed the
latter to Montrose’s cannon, and the Covenanters
let fly some shot at them, one of which
killed “a gallant gentleman, John Seton of
Pitmeddin, most part of his body above the
saddle being carried away.” Johnston’s leg
was crushed by stones brought down from one
of the turrets of the bridge by a cannon-shot,
and he had to be carried off. The loss of their
commander and the disappearance of Aboyne’s
horse discouraged the now small party who
were holding the bridge, and they abandoned
it. Aboyne rode off, and left Aberdeen to
to shift for itself.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c017'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><b>A 9–12, B 9–13.</b> The spoiling of John Seton
by order of Sir William Forbes of Craigievar
is not noticed by Gordon and Spalding,
though other matters of not greater proportion
are.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A 13–15.</b> The reference is to the affair
called the Raid of Stonehaven, June 15, three
days before that of the Bridge of Dee.
Aboyne’s Highlanders, a thousand or more,
were totally unused to artillery, and a few
shots from Montrose’s cannon lighting among
them so frightened them that “they did run
off, all in a confusion, never looking behind
them, till they were got into a moss.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c017'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><b>B 14–17.</b> “When Montrose entered Aberdeen,”
says James Gordon, “the Earl Marischal
and Lord Muchall pressed him to burn
the town, and urged him with the Committee
of Estates’ warrant for that effect. He answered
that it were best to advise a night upon
it, since Aberdeen was the London of the
north, and would prejudice themselves by
want of it. So it was taken to consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>for that night, and next day the Earl Marischal
and Lord Muchall came protesting he
would spare it. He answered he was desirous
so to do, but durst not except they would
be his warrant. Whereupon they drew up a
paper, signed with both their hands, declaring
that they had hindered it, and promising
to interpose with the Committee of Estates
for him. Yet the next year, when he was
made prisoner and accused, this was objected
to Montrose, that he had not burned Aberdeen,
as he had orders from the Committee of
Estates. Then he produced Marischal and
Muchall’s paper, which hardly satisfied the
exasperated committee.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c017'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The earliest copy of this ballad hitherto
found is a broadside of about 1790 (a hundred
and fifty years later than the event celebrated),
which Finlay combined with two
others, derived from recitation, for his edition
(<b>A b</b>). <b>C b</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>, are not purely traditional
texts, and <b>A g</b> has borrowed some stanzas
from <b>C b</b>. <b>C b</b> is transcribed into the Campbell
MSS, I, 184. Aytoun’s edition, 1859,
II, 270, is compounded from <b>A a</b>, <b>A b</b>, with
half a dozen words changed, and it is not quite
clear how the editor means to be understood
when he says, “the following, I have reason
to believe, is the original.”</p>

<p class='c010'>One summer day, Argyle, who has a quarrel
with Airlie, sets out to plunder the castle
of that name. The lord of the place is at the
time with the king. Argyle (something in
the style of Captain Car) summons Lady
Ogilvie to come down and kiss him; else he
will not leave a standing stone in Airlie.
This she will not do, for all his threat. Argyle
demands of the lady where her dowry is
(as if it were tied up in a handkerchief). She
gives no precise information: it is east and
west, up and down the water-side. Sharp
search is made, and the dowry is found in a
plum-tree (balm-tree, cherry-tree, palm-tree,
<b>A a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>g</b>). Argyle lays or leads the
lady down somewhere while the plundering
goes forward. She tells him that no Campbell
durst have taken in hand such a thing if
her lord had been at home. She has born
seven (ten) sons, and is expecting another;
but had she as many more (a hundred more),
she would give them all to King Charles.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>A d</b> 7 Lady Ogilvie asks the favor of
Argyle that he will take her to a high hill-top
that she may <i>not</i> see the burning of Airlie;
the passage is of course corrupt. In <b>A g</b> 7
she more sensibly asks that her face may not
be turned that way. In <b>C a</b> 5, 6, <b>b</b> 5, 6, the
rational request is made that she may be
taken to some dark dowey glen<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c017'><sup>[35]</sup></a> to avoid the
sight; but Argyle leads her “down to the top
of the town,” and bids her look at the plundering,
<b>a</b>; sets her upon a bonnie knowe-tap, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>bids her look at Airlie fa’ing, <b>b</b>. <b>D</b> 7, 8, goes
a step further. The lady asks that she may
be thrown over the castle-wall rather than see
the plundering; Argyle lifts her up ‘sae rarely’
and throws her over, and she never saw it.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>C a</b> 8 Argyle would have Lord Airlie
informed that one kiss from his lady would
have saved all the plundering. In <b>D</b> 5 he
tells Lady Ogilvie that if she had surrendered
on the first demand there would have been
no plundering; and this assurance he repeats
to ‘Captain’ Ogilvie, whom he meets on his
way home.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A b</b> 2, <b>D</b> 1, 2, represent Argyle to be acting
under the orders of Montrose, or in concert
with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>A piece in five or six stanzas which appears,
with variations, in Cromek’s Remains,
p. 195, Hogg’s Jacobite Relics, II, 151, Cunningham’s
Songs of Scotland, III, 218, under
the caption of ‘Young Airly’ (the title of
<b>C b</b> also in Cromek), moves forward the burning
of Airlie to “the 45;” not very strangely
(if there is anything traditional in these
verses), when we consider the prominence of
the younger Lord Ogilvie and his wife among
the supporters of Charles Edward. (The first
three of Cromek’s stanzas are transcribed
into Campbell MSS, I, 187.) No doubt the
Charlie and Prince Charlie of some versions
of our ballad were understood by the reciters
to be the Young Chevalier.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Committee of Estates, June 12, 1640,
gave commission to the Earl of Argyle to rise
in arms against certain people, among whom
was the Earl of Airlie, as enemies to religion
and unnatural to their country, and to pursue
them with fire and sword until they should
be brought to their duty or else utterly subdued
and rooted out. The Earl of Airlie had
gone to England, fearing lest he should be
pressed to subscribe the Covenant, and had
left his house to the keeping of his eldest son,
Lord Ogilvie. Montrose, who had signed
the commission as one of the Committee, but
was not inclined to so strenuous proceedings,
invested Airlie, forced a surrender, and put
a garrison in the place to hold it for the
“public.” Argyle did not interpret his commission
in this mild way. He took Airlie in
hand in the beginning of July, and caused
both this house and that of Forthar, belonging
to Lord Ogilvie, to be pillaged, burned, and
demolished. Thereafter he fell upon the lands
both of the proprietor and his tenantry, and
carried off or destroyed “their whole goods,
gear, corns, cattle, horse, nolt, sheep,” and left
nothing but bare bounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>According to one writer, Lady Ogilvie was
residing at Forthar, and, being big with child,
asked leave of Argyle to stay till she was
brought to bed; but this was not allowed, and
she was put out, though she knew not whither
to go. By another account, Argyle accused
Montrose of having suffered the lady to escape.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c017'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The ballad puts Lady Airlie in command
of the house or castle, but none of the family
were there at the time it was sacked. She is
called Lady Margaret in <b>A b</b> 4, but her name
was Elizabeth. The earl, James, is called the
great Sir John in <b>C a</b> 9. <b>A</b> 10 and the like
elsewhere are applicable to the younger Lady
Ogilvie in respect to the unborn child. Chambers
says that Lady Airlie had three children
and Lady Ogilvie but one, and “the poet
must be wrong.” “The poet,” besides being
inaccurate, does not tell the same story in all
the versions, and this inconsistency is again
observable in ‘Geordie,’ <b>A</b> 9, <b>B</b> 18, <b>C</b> 8, etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Gleyd Argyle’ is “generally described as
of mean stature, with red hair and squinting
eyes.”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c017'><sup>[37]</sup></a> His morals appear to some disadvantage
again in ‘Geordie,’ <b>I a</b> 23.</p>

earlier. A conjectural date of 1720 is given,
with hesitation, to <b>G a</b>, in the catalogue of
the British Museum.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Scottish ballad appears to have been
first printed in the fourth volume of the Tea-Table
Miscellany, 1740, but no copy of that
edition has been recovered. From the Tea-Table
Miscellany it was repeated, with variations,
some traditional, some arbitrary, in:
Herd’s Ancient and Modern Scots Songs,
1769, ‘Gypsie Laddie,’ p. 88, ed. 1776, II,
54; The Fond Mother’s Garland, not dated,
but earlier than 1776; Pinkerton’s Select
Scotish Ballads, 1783, I, 67; Johnson’s Museum,
‘Johny Faa, or, The Gypsie Laddie,’
No 181, p. 189; Ritson’s Scotish Songs, 1794,
II, 176; and in this century, Cromek’s Select
Scotish Songs, 1810, II, 15; Cunningham’s
Songs of Scotland, 1825, II, 175. A transcript
in the Campbell MSS, ‘The Gypsies,’
I, 16, is from Pinkerton.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The people in Ayrshire begin this song,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>

<p class='c011'>They have a great many more stanzas&nbsp;... than
I ever yet saw in any printed.” Burns,
in Cromek’s Reliques, 1809, p. 161. (So
Sharpe, in the Musical Museum, 1853, IV, 217,
but perhaps repeating Burns.) <b>B</b>, from Galloway,
has eight more stanzas than <b>A</b>, and <b>E</b>,
also from Galloway, fourteen more, but quite
eight of the last are entirely untraditional,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c017'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
and the hand of the editor is frequently to be
recognized elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finlay, Scottish Ballads, 1808, II, 39, inserted
two stanzas after <b>A</b> 2, the first of
which is nearly the same as 5, and the second
as <b>B</b> 3, <b>C</b> 3. The variations of his text, and
others in his notes, are given under <b>A</b>. Kinloch
MSS, V, 299; Chambers, Scottish Ballads,
1829, p. 143; Aytoun, 1859, I, 187, repeat
Finlay, with a few slight changes. The
Ballads and Songs of Ayrshire, I, 9, follows
Chambers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The copy in Smith’s Scotish Minstrel, III,
90, is derived from <b>B a</b>, but has readings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>other texts, and is of no authority. That in
Maidment’s Scotish Ballads and Songs, 1868,
II, 185, is <b>B a</b> with changes. Ten stanzas
in a manuscript of Scottish songs and ballads,
copied 1840 or 1850 by a granddaughter of
Lord Woodhouselee, p. 46, are from <b>B a</b>. This
may be true also of <b>B b</b>, which, however, has
not Cassilis in 1<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>C</b> is from a little further north, from Renfrewshire;
<b>D</b> from Aberdeenshire. <b>F</b> is from
the north of England, and resembles <b>C</b>. The
final stanza of <b>G a</b> is cited by Ritson, Scotish
Songs, II, 177, 1794. ‘The Rare Ballad of
Johnnie Faa and the Countess o Cassilis,’
Sheldon’s Minstrelsy of the English Border,
p. 326, which the editor had “heard sung
repeatedly by Willie Faa,” and of which he
“endeavored to preserve as much as recollection
would allow,” has the eleven stanzas of
the English broadside, and twelve more of
which Sheldon must have been unable to recollect
anything. <b>H-K</b> are all varieties of the
broadside.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rev. S. Baring-Gould has most obligingly
sent me a ballad, taken down by him
from the singing of an illiterate hedger in
North Devon, in which ‘The Gypsy Laddie,’
recomposed (mostly with middle rhyme in the
third verse, as in <b>A</b> 1, 8), forms the sequel to
a story of an earl marrying a very reluctant
gypsy maid. When the vagrant who has
been made a lady against nature hears some
of her tribe singing at the castle-gate, the passion
for a roving life returns, and she deserts
her noble partner, who pursues her, and, not
being able to induce her to return to him,
smites her “lily-white” throat with his
sword. This little romance, retouched and
repaired, is printed as No 50 of Songs and
Ballads of the West, now publishing by Baring-Gould
and Sheppard. Mr Baring-Gould
has also given me a defective copy of the
second part of ‘The Gipsy Countess’ (exhibiting
many variations), which he obtained
from an old shoemaker of Tiverton.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the Percy papers there is a set of
ballads made over by the Bishop, which may
have been intended for the contemplated extension
of his Reliques. ‘The Gipsie Laddie,’
in eighteen stanzas, and not quite finished, is
one of these. After seven stanzas of <b>A</b>, not
much altered, the husband ineffectually pursues
the lady, who adopts the gipsy trade,
with her reid cheek stained wi yallow. Seven
years pass, during which the laird has taken
another wife. At Yule a wretched carline
begs charity at his gate, who, upon questioning,
reveals that she had been a lady gay, with
a comely marrow, but had proved false and
ruined herself.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>A.</b> Gypsies sing so sweetly at our lord’s
gate as to entice his lady to come down; as
soon as she shows herself, they cast the glamour
on her (so <b>B-F</b>, <b>G b</b>). She gives herself
over to the chief gypsy, Johny Faa by name,
without reserve of any description. Her lord,
upon returning and finding her gone, sets out
to recover her, and captures and hangs fifteen
gypsies. (It is extremely likely that this
version has lost several stanzas.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Our lord, unnamed in <b>A</b>, is Lord Cassilis in
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b> (so Burns, and Johnson’s Museum).
Cassilis has become Cassle, Castle in <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>,
Corsefield<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c017'><sup>[39]</sup></a> in <b>D</b>, Cashan in Irish <b>I</b>, Garrick<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c017'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
in American <b>K</b>. The Gypsy Laddie is again
Johnie, Jockie, Faa in <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>; but Gipsy
Davy in <b>C</b> (where Lady Cassilis is twice
called Jeanie Faw), and in American <b>I a b</b>;
and seems to be called both Johnnie Faw and
Gypsie Geordie in <b>F</b>. The lady gives the
gypsies the good wheat bread <b>B</b>, <b>E</b> (beer and
wine, Finlay); they give her (sweetmeats,
<b>C</b>) ginger, nutmeg, or both, and she gives
them the ring (rings) off her finger (fingers),
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, (and Finlay).</p>

<p class='c011'><b>B a</b> has a full story from this point on.
The gypsy asks the lady to go with him, and
swears that her lord shall never come near
her. The lady changes her silk mantle for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>plaid, and is ready to travel the world over
with the gypsy, <b>B a</b> 5, <b>A</b> 3, <b>C</b> 4, <b>D</b> 3, <b>E</b> 4,
<b>F</b> 4, (<b>B a</b> 6 is spurious). They wander high
and low till they come to an old barn, and by
this time she is weary. The lady begins to
find out what she has undertaken: last night
she lay with her lord in a well-made bed, now
she must lie in an old barn, <b>B a</b> 7, 8, <b>A</b> 4, <b>C</b> 6,
<b>D</b> 7, <b>F</b> 5 (reeky kill <b>E</b> 8, on a straw bed <b>H</b> 7,
in the ash-corner <b>I</b> 6). The gypsy bids her
hold her peace, her lord shall never come near
her. They wander high and low till they
come to a wan water, and by this time she is
weary. Oft has she ridden that wan water
with her lord; now she must set in her white
feet and wade, <b>B a</b> 11, <b>C</b> 5, <b>D</b> 5, 6, <b>E</b> 7,
(and carry the gipsie laddie, <b>B a</b> 11, badly;
follow, <b>B b</b>). The lord comes home, is told
that his lady is gone off with the gypsy, and
immediately sets out to bring her back (so
all). He finds her at the wan water, <b>B a</b> 14;
in Abbey Dale, drinking wi Gipsey Davy,
<b>C</b> 10; near Strabogie, drinking wi Gypsie
Geordie, <b>F</b> 10;<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c017'><sup>[41]</sup></a> by the riverside, <b>J a</b> 4; at
the Misty Mount, <b>K</b> 5, 6. He asks her tenderly
if she will go home, <b>B a</b> 15, <b>E</b> 15, <b>F</b> 12,
he will shut her up so securely that no man
shall come near, <b>B a</b> 15, <b>E</b> 15; he expostulates
with her, more or less reproachfully, <b>C</b> 11,
<b>F</b> 11, <b>G</b> 9, <b>H</b> 5, <b>J</b> 5. She will not go home;
as she has brewed, so will she drink, <b>B a</b> 16,
<b>G</b> 10; she cares not for houses or lands or
babes (baby) <b>G</b> 10, <b>H</b> 6, <b>J</b> 6. But she swears
to him that she is as free of the gypsies as
when her mother bare her, <b>B a</b> 17, <b>E</b> 16.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fifteen gypsies are hanged, or lose their
lives, <b>A</b> 10, <b>B</b> 18, <b>D</b> 14; sixteen, all sons of
one mother, <b>C</b> 12, 13; seven, <b>F</b> 13, <b>G</b> 11,
(cf. <b>I</b> 1).<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c017'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><b>D</b> 8–11 is ridiculously perverted in the interest
of morals: compare <b>B a</b> 17, <b>E</b> 16. ‘I
swear that my hand shall never go near thee,’
<b>D</b> 8, is transferred to the husband in <b>I</b> 5: ‘A
hand I’ll neer lay on you’ (in the way of correction).</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>G</b> 4 the lady, in place of exchanging her
silk mantle for a plaidie, pulls off her high-heeled
shoes, of Spanish leather, and puts on
Highland brogues. In <b>I</b> 7 gypsies take off her
high-heeled shoes, and she puts on Lowland
brogues. The high-heeled shoes, to be sure,
are not adapted to following the Gypsy Laddie,
but light may perhaps be derived from <b>C</b>
12, where the gypsies ‘drink her stockings and
her shoon.’ In <b>K</b> these high-heeled shoes
of Spanish leather are wrongly transferred to
Lord Garrick in the copy as delivered, but
have been restored to the lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not said (except in the spurious portions
of <b>E</b>) that the lady was carried back by
her husband, but this may perhaps be inferred
from his hanging the gypsies. In <b>D</b> and <b>K</b>
we are left uncertain as to her disposition,
which is elsewhere, for the most part, to stick
to the gypsy. <b>J</b>, a copy of very slight authority,
makes the lord marry again within six
months of his wife’s elopement.</p>

<p class='c011'>The earliest edition of the ballad styles the
gypsy Johny Faa, but gives no clew to the
fair lady. Johnny Faa was a prominent and
frequent name among the gypsies. Johnnë
Faw’s right and title as lord and earl of Little
Egypt were recognized by James V in a document
under the Privy Seal, February 15,
1540, and we learn from this paper that, even
before this date, letters had been issued to the
king’s officers, enjoining them to assist Johnnë
Faw “in execution of justice upon his company
and folks, conform to the laws of Egypt,
and in punishing of all them that rebels
against him.” But in the next year, by an
act of the Lords of Council, June 6, Egyptians
are ordered to quit the realm within thirty
days on pain of death, notwithstanding any
other letters or privileges granted them by the
king, his grace having discharged the same.
The gypsies were expelled from Scotland by
act of Parliament in 1609. Johnnë, <i>alias</i>
Willie, Faa, with three others of the name,
remaining notwithstanding, were sentenced to
be hanged, 1611, July 31. In 1615, January
25, a man was delated for harboring of Egyptians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“specially of Johnnë Fall, a notorious
Egyptian and chieftain of that unhappy sort
of people.” In 1616, July 24, Johnnë Faa,
Egyptian, his son, and two others were condemned
to be hanged for contemptuous repairing
to the country and abiding therein.
Finally, in 1624, January 24, Captain Johnnë
Faa and seven others were sentenced to be
hanged for the same offence, and on the following
29th Helen Faa, relict of the late Captain
Johnnë Faa, with ten other women, was sentenced
to be drowned, but execution was stayed.
Eight men were executed, but the rest, “being
either children and of less-age and women
with child or giving suck to children,” were,
after imprisonment, banished the country
under pain of death, to be inflicted without
further process should they be found within
the kingdom after a day fixed.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c017'><sup>[43]</sup></a> The execution
of the notorious Egyptian and chieftain
Johnny Faa must have made a considerable
impression, and it is presumable that this
ballad may have arisen not long after.
Whether this were so or not, Johnny Faa acquired
popular fame, and became a personage
to whom any adventure might plausibly be
imputed. It is said that he has even been
foisted into ‘The Douglas Tragedy’ (‘Earl
Brand’), and Scott had a copy of ‘Captain
Car’ in which, as in <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, of that ballad, the
scene was transferred to Ayrshire, and the incendiary
was called Johnny Faa.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c017'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Toward the end of the last century we
begin to hear that the people in Ayrshire
make the wife of the Earl of Cassilis the
heroine of the ballad. This name, under the
instruction of Burns, was adopted into the
copy in Johnson’s Museum (which, as to the
rest, is Ramsay’s), and in the index to the
second volume of the Museum, 1788, we
read, “neighboring tradition strongly vouches
for the truth of this story.” After this we
get the tradition in full, of course with considerable
variety in the details, and sometimes
with criticism, sometimes without.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c017'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The main points in the traditional story are
that John, sixth earl of Cassilis, married, for
his first wife, Lady Jean Hamilton, whose
affections were preëngaged to one Sir John
Faa, of Dunbar. Several years after, when
Lady Cassilis had become the mother of two
children,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c017'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Sir John Faa took the opportunity
of the earl’s absence from home (while Lord
Cassilis was attending the Westminster Assembly,
say some) to present himself at the
castle, accompanied by a band of gypsies and
himself disguised as a gypsy, and induced his
old love to elope with him. But the earl returned
in the nick of time, went in pursuit,
captured the whole party, or all but one,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c017'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
who is supposed to tell the story, and hanged
them, on the dule tree, “a most umbrageous
plane, which yet flourishes upon a mound in
front of the castle gate.” The fugitive wife
was banished from board and bed, and confined
for life in a tower at Maybole, built for
the purpose. “Eight heads carved in stone
below one of the turrets are said to be the
effigies of so many of the gypsies.”<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c017'><sup>[48]</sup></a> The
ford by which the lady and her lover crossed
the River Doon is still called The Gypsies’
Steps.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Several accounts put the abduction at the
time when the Earl of Cassilis was attending
the Assembly of Divines at Westminster.
This was in September, 1643. It is now
known that Lady Cassilis died in December,
1642. What is much more important, it is
known from two letters written by the earl
immediately after her death that nothing
could have occurred of a nature to alienate
his affection, for in the one he speaks of her
as a “dear friend” and “beloved yoke-fellow,”
and in the other as his “dear bed-fellow.”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c017'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“Seldom, when stripped of extraneous matter,
has tradition been better supported than
it has been in the case of Johnie Faa and the
Countess of Cassilis:” Maidment, Scotish
Ballads, 1868, II, 184. In a sense not intended,
this is quite true; most of the traditions
which have grown out of ballads have as
slight a foundation as this. The connection
of the ballad with the Cassilis family (as
Mr Macmath has suggested to me) may possibly
have arisen from the first line of some
copy reading, ‘The gypsies came to the castle-gate.’
As <b>F</b> 1<sup>3</sup> has perverted Earl of Cassilis
to Earl of Castle, so Castle may have been corrupted
into Cassilis.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c017'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Cunningham, Songs of Scotland, III, 60,
gives, as recited to him by Sir Walter Scott,
four stanzas which are simply <b>a</b> with ‘Lyndoch
brae’ substituted in the third for
Sharpe’s ‘Stronach haugh.’ ‘Dranoch haugh,’
nearly as in <b>b</b>, is, as will presently appear, the
right reading. Sharpe’s third stanza, with the
absurd variation of <i>royal</i> kin, occurs in a letter
of his of the date November 25, 1811 (Letters,
ed. Allardyce, I, 504), and is printed in
the Musical Museum, IV, *203, ed. 1853.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most important document relating to
Bessy Bell and Mary Gray is a letter written
June 21, 1781, by Major Barry, then proprietor
of Lednock, and printed in the Transactions
of the Society of the Antiquaries of Scotland,
II, 108, 1822.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c017'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“When I came first to Lednock,” says
Major Barry, “I was shewn in a part of my
ground (called the Dranoch-haugh) an heap
of stones almost covered with briers, thorns
and fern, which they assured me was the
burial place of Bessie Bell and Mary Gray.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The tradition of the country relating to
these ladys is, that Mary Gray’s father was
laird of Lednock and Bessie Bell’s of Kinvaid,
a place in this neighbourhood; that they were
both very handsome, and an intimate friendship
subsisted between them; that while Miss
Bell was on a visit to Miss Gray, the plague
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>broke out, in the year 1666; in order to avoid
which they built themselves a bower about
three quarters of a mile west from Lednock
House, in a very retired and romantic place
called Burn-braes, on the side of Brauchie-burn.
Here they lived for some time; but
the plague raging with great fury, they caught
the infection, it is said, from a young gentleman
who was in love with them both. He
used to bring them their provision. They
died in this bower, and were buried in the
Dranoch-haugh, at the foot of a brae of the
same name, and near to the bank of the river
Almond. The burial-place lies about half a
mile west from the present house of Lednock.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c017'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“I have removed all the rubbish from this
little spot of classic ground, inclosed it with a
wall, planted it round with flowering shrubs,
made up the grave double, and fixed a stone
in the wall, on which is engraved the names
of Bessie Bell and Mary [Gray].”</p>

<p class='c011'>The estate passed by purchase to Thomas
Graham, afterwards Lord Lynedoch, who replaced
the wall, which had become dilapidated
in the course of half a century, with a
stone parapet and iron railing, and covered the
grave with a slab inscribed, “They lived, they
loved, they died.” This slab is now hidden
under a cairn of stones raised by successive
pilgrims.</p>

<p class='c011'>Major Barry’s date of 1666 should be put
back twenty years. Perth and the neighborhood
(Lednock is seven miles distant) were
fearfully ravaged by the plague in 1645 and
a year or two following. Three thousand
people are said to have perished. Scotland
escaped the pestilence of 1665–6.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c017'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The young gentleman who is said to have
brought food to Bessy and Mary is sometimes
described as the lover of both, sometimes as
the lover of one of the pair. Pennant says
that the ballad was “composed by a lover
deeply stricken with the charms of both.” In
the course of tradition, the lover is said to have
perished with the young women, which we
might expect to happen if he brought the
contagion to the bower. But this lover, who
ought to have had his place in the song,
appears only in tradition, and his reality may
be called in question. It is not rational that
the young women should seclude themselves
to avoid the pest and then take the risk of
the visits of a person from the seat of the infection.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c017'><sup>[56]</sup></a>
To be sure it may be doubted,
notwithstanding the tenor of the ballad,
whether the retirement of these young ladies
was voluntary, or at least whether they had
not taken the plague before they removed to
their bower. In that case the risk would
have been for the lover, and would have been
no more than he might naturally assume.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c017'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 id='c202' class='c009'>202<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>THE BATTLE OF PHILIPHAUGH</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, III, 153, 1803, II, 166, 1833; “preserved by tradition in Selkirkshire.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>After six brilliant victories, at Tipper-muir,
Aberdeen, Inverlochy, Auldearn, Alford,
Kilsyth, gained in less than a year, September
1, 1644–August 15, 1645, Montrose
was surprised by David Leslie at Philiphaugh,
September 13 following, and his army
cut to pieces or dispersed. This army, consisting
of only five hundred Irish foot and
twelve hundred Scottish horse, the last all
gentry, was lying at Philiphaugh, a meadow
on the west side of the Ettrick, and at Selkirk,
on and above the opposite bank. Leslie
came down from the north with four thousand
cavalry and some infantry, was less than
four miles from Selkirk the night of the
twelfth, and on the morrow, favored by a
heavy mist, had advanced to about half a
mile’s distance before his approach was reported.
A hundred and fifty of Montrose’s
horse received and repulsed two charges of
greatly superior numbers; the rest stood off
and presently took to flight. The foot remained
firm. Two thousand of Leslie’s horse
crossed the river and got into Montrose’s rear,
and made resistance vain. Montrose and a few
friends hewed their way through the enemy.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c017'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>1. Harehead wood is at the western end of
the plain of Philiphaugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>2, 3. Leslie had come up from Berwick
along the eastern coast as far as Tranent, and
then suddenly turned south. His numbers are
put too low, and Montrose’s, in 10, about nine
times too high.</p>

<p class='c011'>4. The Shaw burn is a small stream that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>flows into the Ettrick from the south, a little
north of the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>5. Lingly burn falls into the Ettrick from
the north, a little above the Shaw burn.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ‘aged father,’ 6, to accept a tradition
reported by Sir Walter Scott, was one “Brydone,
ancestor to several families in the parish
of Ettrick.” This is probably the personage
elsewhere called Will, upon whose advice
Leslie (according to tradition again) “sent a
strong body of horse over a dip in the bank
that separated his advanced guard from the
river Ettrick, and still known as “Will’s
Nick,” with instructions to follow their guide
up Netley burn, wheel to the left round
Linglee hill, and then fall upon the flank of
Montrose’s army at Philiphaugh.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c017'><sup>[59]</sup></a> It does
not appear that Leslie adopted that portion
of the aged father’s recommendation which is
conveyed in stanzas 11, 12, notwithstanding
the venerable man’s unusual experience, which,
as Scott points out, extended from Solway
Moss, 1542, to Dunbar, where, in 1650, five
years after Philiphaugh, Leslie was defeated
by Cromwell.</p>

<p class='c010'>First printed by Jamieson (<b>C b</b>) in 1806,
who says: “For the copy of the ballad here
given I am indebted to Mrs Brown. I have
also collated it with another, less perfect, but
not materially different, so far as it goes, with
which I was favored by the editor of the Border
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Minstrelsy, who took it down from the
recitation of two ladies, great-grandchildren
of Farquharson of Inverey; so that the ballad,
and the notices that accompany it, are given
upon the authority of a Gordon [Anne Gordon,
Mrs Brown] and a Farquharson.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c017'><sup>[61]</sup></a> <b>A c</b>
is also a compounded copy: see the notes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The text in The Thistle of Scotland, p. 46,
is <b>C b</b>. That which is cited in part in the
Fourth Report on Historical Manuscripts,
1874, p. 534, is <b>A c</b>. The ballad is rewritten
by Allan Cunningham, Songs of Scotland, II,
208.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A.</b> Inverey comes before day to Brackley’s
gate, and calls to him to open and have his
blood spilled. Brackley asks over the wall
whether the people below are gentlemen or
hired gallows-birds; if gentlemen, they may
come in and eat and drink; in the other case,
they may go on to the Lowlands and steal
cattle. His wife urges him to get up; the
men are nothing but hired gallows-birds.
Brackley will go out to meet Inverey (both
know it is he, 12, 19), but these same gallows-birds
will prove themselves men. His wife
derisively calls on her maids to bring their
distaffs; if Brackley is not man enough to
protect his cattle, she will drive off the robbers
with her women. Brackley says he will go
out, but he shall never come in. He arms
and sallies forth, attended by his brother William,
his uncle, and his cousin; but presently
bids his brother turn back because he is a
bridegroom. William refuses, and in turn,
but equally to no effect, urges Brackley to
turn back for his wife’s and his son’s sake.
The Gordons are but four against four hundred
of Inverey’s, and are all killed. Brackley’s
wife, so far from tearing her hair, braids
it, welcomes Inverey, and makes him a feast.
The son, on the nurse’s knee, vows to be revenged
if he lives to be a man. (Cf. ‘Johnie
Armstrong,’ III, 367, where this should have
been noted.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The other versions agree with <b>A a</b> in the
material points. Inverey’s numbers are diminished.
In <b>B</b> 10, <b>C</b> 11, Brackley has only
his brother with him, meaning, perhaps, when
he leaves his house. The fight was not simply
at the gates, but was extended over a
considerable distance (<b>A</b> 33, <b>B</b> 11), and other
men joined the Gordons in the course of it.
In <b>B</b> 12 we learn that the miller’s four sons
(<b>D</b> 10, the miller and his three sons) were
killed with the Gordons (and William Gordon’s
wife, or bride, in <b>A</b> 25, is ‘bonnie Jean,
the maid o the mill’). In <b>B</b> 15, <b>D</b> 12, Craigevar
comes up with a party, and might have
saved Brackley’s life had he been there an
hour sooner. In <b>A a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, Brackley’s wife
is Peggy (Peggy Dann, wrongly, <b>D</b> 14, 15);
in <b>B</b> 19 (wrongly) Catharine Fraser. <b>D</b>
makes Catharine the wife of Gordon of Glenmuick
(Alexander Gordon, <b>A a</b> 35), who rives
her hair, as Brackley’s wife does not (14, 15,
18, 19). In <b>C</b>, Peggy Gordon, besides feasting
Inverey, keeps him till morning, and then
shows him a road by which he may go safely
home. <b>C b</b> adds, for poetical justice, that
Inverey at once let this haggard down the
wind.</p>

<p class='c011'>This affray occurred in September, 1666.
The account of it given by the Gordons (the
son of the murdered laird and the Marquis of
Huntly) was that John Gordon of Brackley,
having poinded cattle belonging to John Farquharson
of Inverey, or his followers, Inverey
“convoked his people, to revenge himself on
Brackley for putting the law in execution;
that he came to the house of Brackley, and
required the laird to restore his cattle which
had been poinded; and that, although the
laird gave a fair answer, yet the Farquharsons,
with the view of drawing him out of his
house, drove away not only the poinded cattle
but also Brackley’s own cattle, and when
the latter was thus forced to come out of his
house, the Farquharsons fell on him and murdered
him and his brother.”</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Inverey and others, 24 January, 1677, “sets
forth that John Gordon of Brackley, having
bought from the sheriff of Aberdeen the fines
exigible from Inverey and others for killing
of black-fish, the said Brackley made friendly
arrangements with others, but declined to settle
with Inverey; whereupon the latter, being
on his way to the market at Tullich,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c017'><sup>[62]</sup></a> sent Mr
John Ferguson, minister at Glenmuick, John
McHardy of Crathie, a notary, and Duncan
Erskine, portioner of Invergelder, to the laird
of Brackley, with the view of representing to
him that Inverey and his tenants were willing
to settle their fines on the same terms as their
neighbors. These proposals were received by
Brackley with contempt, and during the time
of the communing he gathered his friends and
attacked Inverey, and having ‘loused severall
shotts’ against Inverey’s party, the return
shots of the latter were in self-defence. The
result was that the laird of Brackley, with his
brother William and their cousin James Gordon
in Cults, were killed on the one side, and
on the other Robert McWilliam in Inverey,
John McKenzie, sometime there, and Malcom
Gordon the elder.” The convocation of Inverey’s
friends is accounted for in the same
document by the fact that Inverey was captain
of the watch for the time; that he and
his ancestors had been used to go to the market
with men to guard it; and that it is the
custom of the country for people who are
going to the market to join any numerous
company that may be going the same way,
either for their own security or out of “kindness
for the persons with whom they go,” and
also the custom of that mountainous country
to go with arms, especially at markets.
(Abstract, by Dr. John Stuart, of a MS.
of Col. James Farquharson of Invercauld,
Historical MSS Commission, Fourth Report,
p. 534).</p>

<p class='c011'>Another account, agreeing in all important
points with the last, is given in a history of
the family of Macintosh.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c017'><sup>[63]</sup></a> It will be borne
in mind that Inverey belonged to this clan,
and that acts of his would therefore be put in
a favorable light. Brackley had seized the
horses of some of Inverey’s people on account
of fines alleged to be due by them for taking
salmon in the Dee out of season. Inverey
represented to Brackley that the sufferers by
this proceeding were men who had incurred
no penalty, and offered, if the horses should
be restored, to deliver the guilty parties for
punishment. Brackley would not return the
horses on these terms, and Inverey then proposed
that the matter in dispute should be
left to friends. While Brackley was considering
what to do, Alexander Gordon of Aberfeldy
came to offer his services, with a body
of armed men, and Brackley, now feeling
himself strong, rejected the suggestion of a
peaceful solution, and set out to attack Inverey.
When a collision was impending, Inverey
at first drew back, begging Brackley to
desist from violence, which only made Brackley
and Aberfeldy the keener. Two of Inverey’s
followers were slain; and then Inverey
and his men, in self-defence, turned on
their assailants, and killed Gordon of Brackley,
his brother William, and James Gordon
of Cults.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Gordons, this account further says,
began a prosecution of Inverey and his party
before the Court of Justiciary. Inverey had
recourse to Macintosh, his chief, who exerted
himself so effectually in behalf of his kinsman
that when the case was called no plaintiff
appeared. Nevertheless Dr John Stuart (Historical
MSS, as above) produces a warrant
“for apprehending John Farquharson of Inverey
and others his followers, who had been
outlawed for not compearing to answer at
their trial, and had subsequently continued
for many years in their outlawry, associating
with themselves a company of thieves, murderers,
and sorners; therefore empowering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>James Innes, Serjeant, and Corporal Radnoch,
commanding a party of troops at Kincardine
O’Neill, to apprehend the said John
Farquharson and his accomplices.” From this
warrant Dr Stuart considers that we may infer
that Inverey was the aggressor in the affray
with Brackley. But there is nothing to identify
the case, and the date of the warrant is
February 12, 1685, nearly twenty years from
the affair which we are occupied with, during
which space, unless he were of an unusually
peaceable habit, Inverey might have had several
broils on his hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gordon of Brackley, as reported by Mrs
Brown, from what she may have heard in her
girlhood, a hundred years after his tragical
end, was “a man universally esteemed.”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c017'><sup>[64]</sup></a>
“Farquharson of Inverey,” says Jamieson,
without giving his authority, “a renowned
freebooter on Deeside, was his relation, and in
habits of friendly intercourse with him. Farquharson
was fierce, daring, and active, exhibiting
all the worst characteristics of a freebooter,
with nothing of that blunt and partially
just and manly generosity which were
then not uncommonly met with among that
description of men. The common people
supposed him (as they did Dundee, and others
of the same cast who were remarkable for
their fortunate intrepidity and miraculous
escapes) to be a warlock, and proof against
steel and lead. He is said to have been
buried on the north side of a hill, which the
sun could never shine upon, etc.” All which,
as far as appears, is merely the tradition of
Jamieson’s day, and will be taken at different
values by different readers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ‘Peggy’ of <b>A a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> was Margaret
Burnet, daughter of Sir Thomas Burnet of
Leys, and own cousin of Gilbert Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c017'><sup>[65]</sup></a> This lady married Gordon
of Brackley against her friends’ wishes,
or without their consent, and so probably
made a love-match. After Brackley’s death
she married one James Leslie, Doctor of Medicine,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c017'><sup>[66]</sup></a>
a fact which will suffice to offset the
unconfirmed scandal of the ballad.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is now to be noted that a baron of Brackley
had been murdered by caterans towards
the end of the preceding century. “The
Clanchattan, who, of all that faction, most
eagerly endeavored to revenge the Earl of
Murray his death, assembling their forces
under Angus Donald Williamson his conduct,
entered Strathdee and Glenmuick, where they
invaded the Earl of Huntly his lands, and
killed four of the surname of Gordon, Henry
Gordon of the Knock, Alexander Gordon of
Teldow, Thomas Gordon of Blaircharrish, and
the old baron of Breaghly, whose death and
manner thereof was so much the more lamented
because he was very aged, and much
given to hospitality, and slain under trust.
He was killed by them in his own house after
he had made them good cheer, without suspecting
or expecting any such reckoning for
his kindly entertainment; which happened
the first day of November, 1592. In revenge
whereof the Earl of Huntly assembled some
of his forces and made an expedition into Pettie,”
etc. (See No 183, III, 456.) So writes
Sir Robert Gordon, before 1630.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c017'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Upon comparing Sir Robert Gordon’s description
of the old baron of Brackley who
was murdered in 1592 with what is said of
the baron in the ballad (<b>A</b>), there is a likeness
for which there is no historical authority
in the instance of the baron of 1666. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>ballad intimates the hospitality which is emphasized
by Sir Robert Gordon, and also the
baron’s unconsciousness of his having any foe
to dread. (“An honest aged man,” says
Spotiswood, “against whom they could pretend
no quarrel.”) Other details are not pertinent
to the elder baron, but belong demonstrably
to the Brackley who had a quarrel
with Farquharson.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the two, the older Brackley would have
a better chance of being celebrated in a ballad.
He was an aged and innocent man, slain
while dispensing habitual hospitality, “slain
under trust.” The younger Brackley treated
Inverey’s people harshly, there was an encounter,
Brackley was killed, and others on
both sides. His friends may have mourned
for him, but there was no call for the feeling
expressed in the ballad; that would be more
naturally excited by the death of the kindly
old man, ‘who basely was slain.’ On the
whole it may be surmised that two occurrences,
or even two ballads, have been blended, and
some slight items of corroborative evidence
may favor this conclusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The Gordons may mourn him and bann
Inverey,’ says <b>B</b> 14. It appears that the Earl
of Aboyne sided with Inverey, though the
Marquis of Huntly supported the laird of
Brackley’s son;<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c017'><sup>[68]</sup></a> whereas all the Gordons
would have mourned the older baron, and none
would have maintained the caterans who slew
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the affray with the Farquharsons in 1666
there were killed, of the Gordons, besides
Brackley, his brother William and his cousin
James Gordon of Cults. The Gordons killed
by the Clanchattan in 1592 were Brackley,
Henry Gordon of the Knock, an Alexander
Gordon (also a Thomas). According to <b>A</b>
34, 35, the Gordons killed were Brackley and
his brother William, his cousin James of the
Knox [Knocks, Knock], and his uncle Alexander
Gordon; according to <b>B</b> 12, 13, there
were killed, besides Brackley, “Harry Gordon
and Harry of the Knock” (one and the same
person), Brackley’s brother, as we see from
10; in <b>D</b> 10, the killed are Brackley, and Sandy
Gordon o the Knock, called Peter in 21. A
Gordon of the Knock is named as killed in <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, and it is Henry Gordon in <b>B</b>; an Alexander
Gordon is named in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. A William
Gordon and a James (of the Knocks, not of
the Cults) are named in <b>A</b>. On the whole,
the names sort much better with the earlier
story.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>B</b> 15 we are told that if Craigievar had
come up an hour sooner, Brackley had not
been slain. Upon this Dr Joseph Robertson
(who assigned the ballad to 1592) has
observed, Kinloch MSS, VI, 24, that Craigievar
passed to a branch of the family of
Forbes in 1625; so that Craigievar would
have done nothing to save Brackley in 1666,
the Gordons and the Forbeses having long
been at feud. To make sense of this stanza
we must suppose an earlier date than 1625.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fourth edition of Spotiswood’s history,
printed in 1677 (about forty years after the
author’s death), calls Brackley of 1592 <i>John</i>
Gordon. Further, there is this anonymous
marginal note, not found in the preceding
editions: “I have read in a MS. called the
Acts of the Gordons, that Glenmuick, Glentaner,
Strathdee and Birs were spoiled, and
Brachlie, with his son-in-law, slain, by Mackondoquy
[that is Maconochie, <i>alias</i> Campbell]
of Inner-Aw.”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c017'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Brackley, on the Muick, is in close vicinity
to the village of Ballater, on the Dee, some
forty miles westward from Aberdeen.</p>

but only as a fragment of five stanzas. Pinkerton
repeats three stanzas from Herd, very
slightly “polished by the editor,” Tragic

says Motherwell, was printed in 1798, under
the title of ‘Fair Orange Green.’ <b>A</b> and

in his second edition, 1859, I, 133, and <b>D</b>

Scottish Ballads, p. 157. The “traditionary
version,” in thirty-four stanzas, given in the
Appendix to Motherwell’s Minstrelsy, p. v
(see his Introduction, p. lxiii, note 5), is made
up, all but the fifth stanza and the three last,
from <b>F</b>-<b>J</b> and <b>O</b>: see note to <b>N</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lady Barbara Erskine, eldest daughter of
John, Earl of Mar, was married to James,
second Marquis of Douglas, near the end of
the year 1670. The marriage did not prove
to be happy, and the parties were formally
separated in 1681. They had had one child,
James, Earl of Angus, and he having been
killed in battle in the Netherlands in 1692, the
Marquis of Douglas married again, and had
two sons and a daughter. The second of the
sons was Archibald, the third marquis, and
first and only duke of Douglas.</p>

<p class='c011'>In an affectionate letter of December, 1676
(succeeding several others to which no answer
had been returned), the Marchioness of
Douglas writes to her husband: “I am not
such a stranger to myself to pretend to the
exactness of obedience and duty that my
humor or frowardness may not have offended
you, and all I can say is, that hereafter I shall
so study yours and what may please you that
I shall endeavor a conformity to your good will
so near as I can. This only I must (most)
complain of, that you should retain those in
your service or company who takes the liberty
of talking so much to the prejudice of your
honor and mine. Sure I am I never give the
least occasion for it, neither do I think, my
dear, that you really believe it. If religion
and virtue were not ties strong enough, sense
of your honor and mine own, and of that
noble family of yours and our posterity, could
not but prevail against such base thoughts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>and God, who knows my heart, knows my
innocence and the malice of those who wounds
us both by such base calumnies.” In February,
1677, the marchioness (not for the first
time, as it appears) invokes the interposition
of the Privy Council in her domestic affairs,
and applies for an “aliment” on which she
may live apart from her husband, whom she
charges with shunning her company and
treating her with contempt. The marquis in
his reply alleges that his wife had not treated
him with due respect, but seems to be averse
to a separation. Four years after, a separation
was mutually agreed to, and in the contract
to this effect the ground is expressed to be
“great animosities, mistakes and differences betwixt
the said marquis and his lady, which have
risen to a great height, so as neither of them
are satisfied longer to continue together.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c017'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The blame of the alienation of Douglas from
his wife is imputed by tradition to William
Lawrie, the marquis’s principal chamberlain
or factor, who was appointed to that place in
1670, the year of the marriage. Lawrie married
Marion Weir, of the family of Blackwood,
then a widow. He is often styled the laird
of Blackwood, a title which belonged to his
son by this marriage, his own proper designation
being, after that event, the Tutor of
Blackwood. “The belief that Blackwood
was the chief cause of this unhappy quarrel
was current at the time among the Douglas
tenantry, with whom he was very unpopular,
and it is corroborated by letters and other documents
in the Douglas charter-chest. The
marchioness, indeed, evinces temper, but the
marquis appears to have been morose and
peevish, and incapable of managing his own
affairs. In this matter he consulted, and was
advised by, Blackwood at every step, sending
him copies of the letters he wrote to his wife,
and subscribing whatever document Blackwood
thought fit to prepare. Members of the
family and dependents alike characterized
Lawrie as hypocritical and double-dealing; but
on the other hand, it is only fair to mention
that on two occasions, Charles, Earl of Mar,
wrote to Blackwood thanking him for his
kindness to his sister, and assuring him of his
esteem.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c017'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>John, Earl of Mar, the father of Lady
Barbara Erskine, died in 1668, before his
daughter’s marriage, and it would have been
her brother Charles, the next earl, who took
her home. He was colonel of a regiment of
foot at the time of the separation, whence, probably,
the drums, trumpets, and soldiers in the
ballad. Barbara Douglas died in 1690, two
years before the marquis’s second marriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The reciter of <b>A</b>, who got her information
from an old dey at Douglas castle, as far back
as 1770, told Kinloch that the ballad was a
great favorite with Archibald, Duke of Douglas,
who lived till 1761. “The Duke used
often to get the old dey to sing it to him
while he wheeled round the room in a gilded
chair&nbsp;... and muttered anathemas against
Lourie, saying, O that Blackwood must have
been a damned soul!”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c017'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The story of the ballad is very simple. A
lady, daughter of the Earl of Mar, <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>, married
to Lord James Douglas, Marquis of
Douglas, <b>D</b>, lives happily with him until
Blackwood (Blacklaywood, Blackly) makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>her husband believe that she has trespassed
(with one Lockhart, <b>A</b>). Her protestations
of innocence and the blandishments with
which she seeks to win back her lord’s affections
are fruitless. Her father sends for her
and takes her home. He offers to get a bill
of divorce and make a better match for her,
but she will listen to no such proposal.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady is daughter of the Earl of York,
<b>D</b>; her brother is the Duke of York (a somewhat
favorite personage in ballads), <b>B</b>; her
mother is daughter of the Duke of York, <b>G</b>,
and her father is the Lord of Murray. Her
husband is the Earl of March, <b>I</b> (and <b>F</b>?).
Had she foreseen the event of the marriage
with Douglas, she would have staid
at Lord Torchard’s gates (Argyle’s, Athol’s,
Lord Orgul’s) and have been his lady, <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, or in fair Orange green and have
been his (Orange’s?) <b>K</b>. (Orange gate appears
in <b>D</b>, also, and so it may be Orange
wine, and not orange, that Jamie Douglas
is invited to drink in <b>I</b> 5.) A handsome
nurse makes trouble in <b>F</b> 6, but nowhere
else. It is not Blackwood that whispers mischief
into the husband’s ear in <b>J</b> 4, but a
small bird; a black bird, fause bird, in two
of Finlay’s three copies, a blackie in the
other, <b>L</b>. In <b>E</b> 7 the lady will not wash her
face, comb her hair, or have fire or light in
her bower: cf. Nos 69, 92, II, 156, 317. In
<b>I</b> 15, when the lady had returned to her
father’s and the tenants came to see her, she
could not speak, and “the buttons off her
clothes did flee;” “an affecting image of
overpowering grief,” says Chambers.  See
also ‘Andrew Lammie.’</p>

<p class='c011'><b>D</b> 10–15, <b>N</b>, are palpable and vulgar tags
to a complete story. James Douglas comes
to his father-in-law’s house with his three
children, and sends a soldier to the gate to bid
his lady come down; he has hanged false
Blackwood, and she is to come home: <b>N</b>. In
<b>D</b> the hanging of Blackwood is not mentioned;
Douglas calls for wine to drink to his
gay lady, she takes a cup in her hand, but her
heart breaks.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c017'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><b>A</b>-<b>M</b> have all from one stanza to four of a

the eighteenth century, and printed fifty years
earlier than any copy of the ballad.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c017'><sup>[74]</sup></a> This
song is the lament of an unmarried woman for
a lover who has proved false, and, as we find
by the last stanza, has left her with an unborn
babe. <b>A</b>, <b>C</b> have this last stanza, although
the lady in these copies has born three children
(as she has in every version except the
fragmentary <b>E</b>).<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c017'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'>Motherwell’s ballad is “traditionary” to the
extent that it is substantially made up from
traditionary material. The text of the recited
copies is not always strictly adhered to.
The fifth stanza happens not to occur in the
texts used, but may have come in in some
other recitation obtained by Motherwell, or
may simply have been adopted from Ramsay.
The three last stanzas (<b>N</b>) are from some
recitation not preserved in Motherwell’s relics.

<p class='c010'>The “gospel-lads,” otherwise self-styled
the true Presbyterian party, had in 1679,
May 29 (observed both as the king’s birthday
and the anniversary of the Restoration),
begun their testimony against the iniquity of
the times by publishing a Declaration, putting
out loyal bonfires, and burning all acts
of Parliament obnoxious to Covenanters, in
retaliation for the burning of the Covenant at
London seventeen years before. They had
intended to do this at Glasgow, but as Claverhouse
had established himself there, the demonstration
was made at Rutherglen, a little
place two miles off. On the 31st Claverhouse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>laid hands on three of the rioters and an outlawed
minister. The Covenanters had appointed
a great meeting, an armed conventicle,
for the next day, Sunday, June 1, at
Loudon Hill, on the borders of the shires
of Ayr and Lanark. Not so many came
as were expected, for Claverhouse had been
heard of, but there were at least two hundred
and fifty armed men; and these numbers
were subsequently increased.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c017'><sup>[78]</sup></a> It was
resolved to rescue the prisoners taken the
day before, if the Lord should enable them,
and in prosecution of this object they moved
on to Drumclog, a swampy farm two miles
east of Loudon Hill. The chief of command
was Robert Hamilton, and with him were associated
John Balfour of Kinloch, called Burly,
Hackston of Rathillet, and others. What
ensued is told in a frank letter of Claverhouse,
written the night of the same Sunday.</p>

<p class='c011'>The prisoners were to be conveyed to Glasgow.
“I thought,” says Claverhouse, “that
we might make a little tour, to see if we could
fall upon a conventicle; which we did, little to
our advantage. For, when we came in sight
of them, we found them drawn up in battle,
upon a most advantageous ground, to which
there was no coming but through mosses and
lakes. They were not preaching, and had
got away all their women and children. They
consisted of four battalions of foot, and all
well armed with fusils and pitchforks, and
three squadrons of horse. We sent, both, parties
to skirmish, they of foot and we of dragoons;
they run for it, and sent down a battalion
of foot against them (the dragoons).
We sent threescore of dragoons, who made
them run again shamefully. But in the end
(they perceiving that we had the better of
them in skirmish), they resolved a general
engagement, and immediately advanced with
their foot, the horse following. They came
through the loch, and the greatest body of all
made up against my troop. We kept our fire
till they were within ten pace of us. They
received our fire and advanced to shock. The
first they gave us brought down the cornet,
Mr Crafford, and Captain Bleith. Besides
that, with a pitchfork, they made such an
opening in my sorrel horse’s belly that his guts
hung out half an ell, and yet he carried me off
a mile; which so discouraged our men that
they sustained not the shock, but fell into disorder.
Their horse took the occasion of this,
and pursued us so hotly that we got no time
to rally. I saved the standards, but lost on
the place about eight or ten men, besides
wounded. But the dragoons lost many more.
They are not come easily off on the other
side, for I saw several of them fall before we
came to the shock. I made the best retreat
the confusion of our people would suffer.”<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c017'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The cornet killed was Robert Graham, the
“nephew” of Claverhouse, of whom so much
is made in “Old Mortality.” There is no evidence
beyond the name to show that he was a
near kinsman of his captain. The Covenanters
thought they had killed Claverhouse himself,
because of the name Graham being
wrought into the cornet’s shirt, and treated
the body with much brutality. In ‘Bothwell
Bridge,’ st. 12, Claverhouse is represented as
refusing quarter to the Covenanters in revenge
for ‘his cornet’s death.’<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c017'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, III, 209, 1803; II, 226, 1833. From recitation.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The report of the success of the Covenanters
at Drumclog brought four or five thousand
malcontents into the rising, many of whom,
however, were not radicals of the Hamilton
type, but moderate Presbyterians. After not
a little moving up and down, they established
their camp on the nineteenth of June at Hamilton,
on the south side of the Clyde, near the
point where the river is crossed by Bothwell
Bridge. They were deficient in arms and ammunition
and in officers of military experience.
“But,” as a historian of their own
party says, “the greatest loss was their want
of order and harmony among themselves;
neither had they any person in whom they
heartily centred, nor could they agree upon
the grounds of their appearance.” Both before
and after their final encampment at Hamilton,
they were principally occupied with debating
what testimony they should make
against Popery, Prelacy, Erastianism, and the
Indulgence, and whether their declaration
should contain an acknowledgment of the
king’s authority. Dissension ran high, “and
enemies had it to observe and remark that
ministers preached and prayed against one
another.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king named the Duke of Monmouth
to command his army in Scotland. Both
the instructions which were given him and
the duke’s own temper were favorable to an
accommodation. The royal forces were at
Bothwell Muir on the twenty-second of June,
and their advanced guards within a quarter
of a mile of the bridge. The duke marched
his army to an eminence opposite the main
body of the enemy, who lay on the moor (st.
10). The bridge was held by Hackston of
Rathillet and other resolute men. It was
very defensible, being only twelve feet wide
and rising from each end to the middle, where
there was a gate, and it was also obstructed
with stones. Early in the morning a deputation
was sent by the rebels to the duke to lay
before him their demands. He heard them
patiently, and expressed his willingness to do
all that he could for them with the king, but
would engage himself to nothing until they
laid down their arms. He gave them an hour
to make up their mind. The officers of the
insurgents were unable to come to an agreement.
Hamilton, who assumed the general
command, was against any pacific arrangement,
and no answer was returned. In the
interim four field-pieces had been planted
against the bridge. The defenders maintained
themselves under the fire of these and
of the musketeers and dragoons until their
own powder was exhausted, and then unwillingly
withdrew to the main body, by Hamilton’s
order. The bridge was cleared of obstructions,
and the royal army crossed and
advanced in order of battle against the rebels
on the moor. The first fire made the Covenanters’
horse wheel about, and their retreat
threw the nearest foot into disorder; in consequence
of which the whole army fell into
confusion. Twelve hundred surrendered without
resistance, the rest fled, and several hundred
were killed in the pursuit.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c017'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>1–9. William Gordon of Earlston, a hot
Covenanter, while on his way to Hamilton
on the twenty-second to join the insurgents,
fell in with some dragoons who were pursuing
his already routed copartisans, and, resisting
their attempt to make him prisoner, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>killed. His son Alexander, a man of more
temperate views, was at Bothwell Bridge,<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c017'><sup>[82]</sup></a>
and escaped. Although Earlston in st. 4 is
represented as bidding farewell to his father,
the grotesque narrative with which the ballad
begins can be understood only of the father;
sts. 7, 8 make this certain.</p>

<p class='c011'>9. It seems to be meant, as grammar would
require, that it is the ‘Lennox lad,’ and a
Covenanter, that sets up ‘the flag of red set
about with blue.’ In “Old Mortality,” Sir
Walter Scott makes the Covenanters plant
“the scarlet and blue colors of the Scottish
covenant” on the keep of Tillietudlem.
Whether he had other authority than this
ballad for the scarlet, I have not been able
to ascertain. All the flags of the covenant
may not have been alike, but all would probably
have a ground of blue, which is known
to have been the Covenanters’ color. One flag,
which belonged to a Covenanter who figured
at Drumclog and Bothwell Bridge, has fortunately
been preserved. It is of blue silk,
with three inscriptions, one of which is, “No
Quarters to y<sup>e</sup> Active Enimies of y<sup>e</sup> Covenant,”
first painted in some light color, afterwards
repainted in a dull red. (Napier, I, xliv).</p>

<p class='c011'>The last half of the stanza must be spoken
by Monmouth, and the tone of it is more chivalrous
than the circumstances call for.</p>

<p class='c011'>12–15. For Claverhouse’s cornet, see the
preceding ballad. Captain John Graham, for
that was all he then was, was not conspicuous
at Bothwell Bridge. He commanded the
horse on the right, and Captain Stuart the
dragoons on the left, when the advance was
made on the Covenanters. He was as capable
of insubordination as Robert Hamilton was of
Erastianism, and it is nearly as unnecessary, at
this day, to vindicate him from the charge of
cruelty as from that of procuring Monmouth’s
execution six years in advance of the fates.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c017'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>‘Earlistoun,’ Chambers, Twelve Romantic
Scottish Ballads, p. 26, is this piece with the
battle omitted, or stanzas 1–6, 7<sup>1,2</sup>, 8<sup>3,4</sup>, 16.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scott observes: “There is said to be another
song upon this battle, once very popular,
but I have not been able to recover it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a stall-ballad of Bothwell Brigg,
not traditional, a very good ballad of its sort,
with a touching story and a kindly moral,
which may or may not be later than Sir
Walter Scott’s day. It is of John Carr and
his wife Janet and a non-covenanting lady, who
carries off John, badly wounded, from the field
(where he had fought better than most of his
party), and nurses him in her lord’s castle till
he is well enough to be visited by his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr Rimbault remembered hearing a version
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>sung at a village in Staffordshire, about
1842, in which Hereford was substituted for
Devonshire: Notes and Queries, First Series,
V, 348, 1852.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Delamere, upon occasion of the imposition
of some new taxes, begs a boon of the
king, in the Parliament House; it is that he
may have all the poor men in the land down
to Cheshire and hang them, since it would be
better for them to be hanged than to be
starved. A French (Dutch) lord says that
Delamere ought to be stabbed for publicly
affronting the king. The Duke of Devonshire
offers himself to fight for Delamere, and a
stage is set up for a duel to the utterance.
Devonshire’s sword bends at the first thrust and
then breaks. An English lord who is standing
by (Willoughby, <b>B</b>) gives him another, and
advises him to play low, for there is treachery.
Devonshire drops on his knee and gives
his antagonist his death-wound. The king
orders the dead man to be taken away, but
Devonshire insists on first examining the body.
He finds that the French lord had been wearing
armor, and the king’s armor, while he
himself was fighting bare. He reproaches
the king with the purpose of taking his life,
and tells him that he shall not have his armor
back until he wins it.</p>

<p class='c011'>According to the title of <b>B</b>, the duel was
between Devonshire and Lord Danby, and in
1687. The other party is, however, called a
Dutch lord in the ballad. The king is James.
Delamere is said to be under age (he was
thirty-five in 1687).</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>D</b>, Delamere is changed to Delaware, of
Lincolnshire; the Duke of Devonshire is
called a Welsh lord, and fights a Dutch lord
in defence of <i>young</i> Delaware. When Devonshire’s
sword breaks, he springs from the
stage, borrows another from a soldier in the
ring, and leaps back to the stage.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is scarcely necessary to say that the duel
is on a par for historical verity with that in
‘Johnie Scot’ (No 99). If there was to be a
duel, Devonshire (Earl, he was not created
Duke till 1694, the last year of Delamere’s
life) was well chosen for the nonce. He had
fought with Lord Mohun, in 1676, and was
credited with challenging Count Königsmark,
in 1682. What is true in the ballad is that
Delamere was a strenuous and uncompromising
advocate of constitutional government,
and that he and Devonshire were political and
personal friends. Both were particularly active
in bringing in the Prince of Orange; and
so was Lord Danby, with whom, according to
the title of <b>B</b>, Devonshire was fighting the
duel the year before the revolution.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has been suggested,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c017'><sup>[84]</sup></a> and it is barely
conceivable, that the ballad may have grown
out of a perverted report of the affair of
the Earl of Devonshire with Colonel Colepepper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On Sunday the 24th of April, 1687, the
said earl, meeting on Colonel Culpepper in
the drawing-room in Whitehall (who had
formerly affronted the said earl in the king’s
palace, for which he had not received any satisfaction),
he spake to the said colonel to go
with him into the next room, who went with
him accordingly; and when they were there,
the said earl required of him to go down stairs,
that he might have satisfaction for the affront
done him, as aforesaid; which the colonel
refusing to do, the said earl struck him with
his stick, as is supposed.”<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c017'><sup>[85]</sup></a> For this, Devonshire
was summoned to the King’s Bench and
required to give sureties to the amount of
£30,000 that he would appear to stand trial.
Delamere was surety for £5,000. Devonshire
was in the end fined £30,000, and Delamere
made a strong plea, apparently in the
House of Lords, against the legality of the
proceedings of the court.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is the slightest possible similitude
here to the facts of the ballad. It is merely
that one party stands up for the other; but
Delamere appears as the champion of Devonshire,
not Devonshire of Delamere. If Devonshire
had testified for Delamere when the
latter was tried for high treason in 1686,
there would be something to go upon. A
more plausible explanation is desirable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three stanzas of this ballad were printed
in 1812 (<b>C</b>). <b>I</b> followed in 1825, a full copy,
which would have been a very good one had
it been given as taken down, and not restored
“to something like poetical propriety.”<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c017'><sup>[86]</sup></a> The
editor of the “old song” observes that it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>one of the most popular in the north of England
for a long period after the event which
it records, and a glance at what is here brought
together will show that the ballad was at least
equally popular in Scotland. <b>I</b> is repeated in
Richardson’s Borderer’s Table-Book, VI, 291,
and in Harland and Wilkinson’s Ballads and
Songs of Lancashire, 1882, p. 265. Mr J. H.
Dixon, in Notes and Queries, 4th Series, XI,
389, says that the ballad “originally appeared
in the Town and Country Magazine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Lord Derwentwater’s Goodnight,’ Hogg’s
Jacobite Relics, II, 30, 268, was both communicated
and composed by Robert Surtees.
‘Derwentwater,’ Cromek’s Remains of Nithsdale
and Galloway Song, 1810, p. 127, is from
the pen of Allan Cunningham. It is repeated
in Hogg’s Jacobite Relics, 1821, II, 28, and
in Cunningham’s Songs of Scotland, 1825,
III, 192, etc.; also in Kinloch MSS, V, 413,
with two lines to fill out an eighth stanza.
(Translated by Loève-Veimars, p. 375.)
‘Young Ratcliffe,’ Sheldon’s Minstrelsy of
the English Border, p. 400, is another ballad
of the same class.</p>

<p class='c010'>James Ratcliffe, Earl of Derwentwater,
being suspected or known to be engaged in
concerting a rising in the north of England in
behalf of the Pretender, a warrant was issued
by the Secretary of State for his apprehension,
towards the end of September, 1715. Hereupon
he took arms, and he was one of the
fifteen hundred English and Scots who were
forced to an inglorious surrender at Preston,
November 14. The more distinguished prisoners
were conveyed to London, where they
had a boisterous reception from the mob.
Derwentwater was committed to the Tower,
December 9; was impeached of high treason,
and pleaded guilty, in January; was sentenced
to death, February 9, at Westminster
Hall, and was executed February 24 (1716).
In a paper which he read from the scaffold he
stated that he had regarded his plea of guilty
as a formality consequent upon his “having
submitted to mercy,” and declared that he
had never had “any other but King James the
Third for his rightful and lawful sovereign.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Derwentwater had not attained the age of
twenty-seven at the time of his death. We
may believe that the character given of him
by the renegade Patten was not overcharged:
“The sweetness of his temper and disposition,
in which he had few equals, had so secured
him the affection of all his tenants, neighbors,
and dependants that multitudes would have
lived and died with him. The truth is, he
was a man formed by nature to be generally
beloved, for he was of so universal a beneficence
that he seemed to live for others. As
he lived among his own people, there he spent
his estate, and continually did offices of kindness
and good neighborhood to everybody, as
opportunity offered. He kept a house of
generous hospitality and noble entertainment,
which few in that country do, and none come
up to. He was very charitable to poor and
distressed families on all occasions, whether
known to him or not, and whether Papist or
Protestant. His fate will be sensibly felt by
a great many who had no kindness for the
cause he died in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The king’s letter, which, in the ballad,
summons Derwentwater to London (to answer
for his head, <b>D</b> 3), suggests the Secretary
of State’s warrant of arrest, which his lordship,
unhappily for himself, evaded. But very
probably the ballad-maker supposed Derwentwater
to have gone home after his less than
six weeks in arms. As he is setting forth to
obey the mandate, his wife calls to him from
child-bed to make his will. This business
does not delay him long: one third of his estate
is to be his wife’s, and the rest to go to
his children. (He had a son not two years
old at the date of his execution, and a daughter
who must have been born, at the earliest, not
much before the rising. His very large estates
first passed to the crown, and were afterwards
bestowed on Greenwich hospital.)
Bad omens attend his departure. As he
mounts his horse, his ring drops from his
finger, or breaks, and his nose begins to bleed,
<b>B</b> 5, <b>D</b> 6, <b>E</b> 8, <b>F</b> 9, <b>H</b> 7, <b>I</b> 10; presently his
horse stumbles, <b>A</b> 8, <b>E</b> 9, <b>F</b> 10, <b>I</b> 11; it
begins to rain, <b>H</b> 8. When he comes to London,
to Westminster Hall, <b>B</b> 6, <b>F</b> 11, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Whitehall, <b>D</b> 7, rides up Westminster Street,
in sight of the White Hall, <b>I</b> 12, the lords
and knights, the lords and ladies, a mob, <b>H</b>
9, call him “traitor.” How can that be, he
answers, with surprise or indignation, except
for keeping five hundred men (five thousand,
seven thousand, eight score), to fight for King
Jamie? <b>A</b> 10, <b>D</b> 8, <b>E</b> 11, <b>F</b> 12, <b>H</b> 10, <b>I</b> 13.
A man with an ax claims his life, which he
ungrudgingly resigns, <b>B</b> 8, <b>D</b> 9, 10, <b>E</b> 12, 13,
<b>F</b> 13, 14, <b>H</b> 11, 12, <b>I</b> 14, 15, directing that a
good sum of money which he has in his pockets
shall be given to the poor, <b>A</b> 12, <b>D</b> 11, <b>E</b> 14,
<b>F</b> 15, <b>I</b> 17.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>A</b> 2, <b>D</b> 12, Derwentwater seems to be
taken for a Scot.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ellis, Brand’s Antiquities, 1813, II, 261,
note, remarks that he had heard in Northumberland
that when the Earl of Derwentwater
was beheaded, the stream (the Divelswater)
that runs past his seat at Dilston Hall flowed
with blood.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c017'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The Northern Lights (perhaps the red-colored
ones) were peculiarly vivid on the night
of February 16, 1716, and were long called
Lord Derwentwater’s Lights in the north of
England, where, it is said, many of the people
know (or knew) them by no other name. It
was even a popular belief that the aurora
borealis was first seen on that night: Notes
and Queries, Third Series, IX, 154, 268; Gibson,
Dilston Hall, p. 111.</p>

<p class='c011'>The omen of nose-bleed occurs in the ballad
of ‘The Mother’s Malison,’ No 216, <b>C</b>; both
nose-bleed and horse-stumbling, as omens, in
Webster’s Dutchess of Malfi, Act II, Scene
2, Dyce, 1859, p. 70, cited, with other cases,
in Ellis’s ed. of Brand’s Antiquities, II, 497.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Brig. Macintosh’s Farewell to the Highlands,’
or ‘Macintosh was a Soldier Brave,’
is one half a Derwentwater ballad: see Harland’s
Ballads and Songs of Lancashire, 1865,
p. 75, Ritson’s Northumberland Garland, p.
85, Hogg’s Jacobite Relics, II, 102, etc.</p>

stanza.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of this,” says Motherwell, “many variations
exist among reciters,” and his remark is
borne out by what is here given.</p>

<p class='c011'>The copy in Cunningham’s Songs of Scotland,
II, 186, is <b>A</b> retouched, with st. 5
dropped and two stanzas (<b>L</b>) inserted from
recitation. The texts of Christie, <b>I</b>, 52, 84,
are <b>J</b> abridged and <b>E b</b>. Of <b>J</b> Christie says
that he heard in 1848 a version sung by a native
of Buchan, Aberdeenshire, who had it
through her grandmother and great-grandmother,
which differed only in being more
condensed and wanting the catastrophe, and
in having Badenoch’s lady for Bignet’s, and
Keith-Hall and Gartly for Black Riggs and
Kincraigie.</p>

<p class='c010'>Geordie Gordon, <b>A</b>, of Gight (Gigh), <b>B b</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>I</b>, of the Bog o Gight, <b>H</b>, is in prison,
on a charge endangering his life. He sends a
message to his wife to come to Edinburgh.
She rides thither with the utmost haste, and
finds Geordie in extremity. She is told that
his life may be redeemed by the payment of
a large sum of money. She raises a contribution
on the spot, pays the ransom, and
rides off with her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kinloch and others incline to take Geordie
to be George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly,
who incurred the Queen Regent’s displeasure
for failing to execute a commission against a
Highland robber in 1554. Huntly was committed
to Edinburgh Castle, and some of his
many enemies urged that he should be banished
to France, others that he should be put
to death. The Earl of Cassilis, though a foe
to Huntly, resisted these measures on grounds
of patriotism, and proposed that he should be
deprived of certain honors and offices and
fined. A fine was exacted, and the places
which had been taken from him were restored.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c017'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
With regard to this hypothesis, it
may at least be said that, if it should be accepted,
the ballad would be quite as faithful
to history as many others.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A</b>-<b>E</b> are the purer forms of the ballad;
<b>F</b>-<b>J</b> are corrupted by admixture.</p>

<p class='c011'>Geordie is Geordie Lukely of Stirling in <b>F</b>.
In <b>G</b>, he is the Earl of Cassilis, ‘of Hye,’ as
if some singer of the Gordons had turned the
tables on Huntly’s enemy. In <b>H</b>, Geordie
lives at the Bog o Gight, and should be the
Earl, or Marquis, of Huntly; but writers of
peerages will consult st. 17.</p>

<p class='c011'>There has been a battle in the North in
<b>A</b>-<b>E</b>. Sir Charles Hay<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c017'><sup>[89]</sup></a> has been killed, and
Geordie is in custody for this, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. Geordie
has killed a man and is to die, <b>C</b>; the man is
his wife’s brother, <b>D</b>. In <b>E</b>, Geordie is a
rebel.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>F</b> begins with two stanzas from a vulgar
last-dying-speech, of which more by and by:
otherwise the story is not essentially injured,
though the style is lowered. Geordie (in the
first two stanzas) has done many an ill deed,
but no murder or slaughter; he has stolen
fifteen of the king’s horse and sold them in
Bohemia. Earl Cassilis, likewise, in <b>G</b>, could
not keep his hand off horses; he has stolen
three geldings out of a park and sold them
to Balleny (Balveny). Huntly, if it be he,
in <b>H</b>, has only made free with the king’s deer.
In <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, Geordie has had an intrigue with Bignet’s
(Pilbagnet’s, Badenoch’s) lady, for
which the husband has thrown him into
prison, and he is to die. But he owns to more
than this in <b>J</b>. Beginning with an acknowledgment
of one of the king’s best steeds stolen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>and sold in ‘Bevany,’ upon being pressed, he
confesses to a woman abused and five orphan
babes killed for their money.</p>

<p class='c011'>Geordie points his message to his wife in
<b>C</b> 2, <b>D</b> 4, by begging her to sew him or
bring him his linen shirt (shirts), a good side
shirt, which will be the last he shall need, and
a lang side sark is equally prominent in the
lady’s thoughts in <b>I</b> 8.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady stops for nothing in her ride to
Edinburgh. She will not, and does not, eat or
drink all the way, <b>A</b> 4, 5. When she comes
to the water-side, finding no boat ready, she
swims the Queen’s Ferry, <b>B</b> 7, <b>C</b> 5, <b>D</b> 9, <b>J</b> 13,
<b>L</b> 1; or pays a boatman prodigally to take
her over, <b>H</b> 9, <b>I</b> 9, <b>J</b> 14.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the lady gaes oer the pier of Leith,
comes to Edinburgh, to the West Port, the Canongate,
the Parliament Close, the tolbooth-stair,
the prison-door, she deals out crowns and
ducatoons, makes the handfus o red gold fly,
among the numerous poor, and bids them pray
for Geordie. She has the prudence, in <b>G</b> 5,
to do the same among the nobles many at
the tolbooth-gate, that they may plead for
Geordie.</p>

<p class='c011'>The block and axe are in sight, and Geordie,
in chains, is coming down the stair, <b>A</b>; the
napkin is laid over his face, and the gallows is
making ready, <b>B</b> (so <b>F</b>, but put further on),
his head is to go, <b>C</b>; the rest of the nobles sit
(stand) hat on head, but hat in hand stands
Geordie, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>L</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady makes a plea for her husband’s
life. She is the mother of many children (the
tale ranges from six to eleven) and is going
with yet another, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>N</b>. She would
bear them all over again for the life of
Geordie, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, or see them all streekit before
her eyes, <b>B</b>; and for his life she will part
with all that she owns, <b>A</b> 10, <b>B</b> 11, 16,
<b>D</b> 14.</p>

<p class='c011'>The king in <b>A</b> is moved by neither of these
appeals. The number of her children is so
far from affecting him that he orders the
heading-man to make haste. But the Gordons
collect and pass the word to be ready. There
would have been bloody bouks upon the
green.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c017'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The lady is told that by paying a good
round sum, 5,000 (500) pounds, 10,000 (1000)
crowns, she can redeem Geordie’s life. An
aged lord prompts the king to offer these terms
in <b>A</b>; in the other versions, they are proposed
directly; by the king himself, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>; by
the queen, <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>; by the good Argyle, <b>D</b>; by
an English lord, <b>H</b>. The bystanders contribute
handsomely; she pays the ransom
down, and wins the life of Geordie, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>,
<b>G</b>-<b>J</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>E</b>, which is a mere fragment, there is
no fine or collection: a bold baron says, such
true lovers shall not be parted, and she gets
her Geordie forthwith. In <b>F</b>, no contribution
is required, because the lady, after scattering
the red gold among the poor, is still in a condition
to produce the five thousand pound
from her own pocket. For this she receives a
‘remit,’ with which she hies to the gallows
and stops the impending execution. In <b>I b</b>,
which is defective, the money collected is to
pay the jailer’s fee. After the discharge has
been secured (in two or three copies earlier),
Lord Corstorph, <b>B a</b>, the Laird o Logie, <b>B b</b>,
an Irish lord, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, an English lord, <b>D</b>, the
<i>gleid</i> Argyle, <b>I</b>, Lord Montague, <b>J</b>, expresses
a wish that Geordie’s head were off, because
he might have succeeded to the lady. The
lady checks this aspiration, sometimes in very
abusive language.</p>

<p class='c011'>The pair now ride off together, and when
she is set in her saddle, no bird in bush or on
briar ever sang so sweet as she, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>I</b>. If we were to trust some of those who
recite her story, the lady who has shown so
much spirit and devotion was not one of those
who blush to find good deeds fame. ‘Gar
print me ballants that I am a worthy lady,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span><b>B</b> 30 makes her say; ‘Hae me to some writer’s
house, that I may write down Gight’s lament
and how I borrowed Geordie,’ <b>I a</b> 25;
‘Call for one of the best clerks, that he may
write all this I’ve done for Geordie,’ <b>J</b> 36.
What she really did say is perhaps faithfully
given in <b>D</b> 18: ‘Where is there a writer’s
house, that I may write to the north that I
have won the life of Geordie?’</p>

<p class='c011'><b>I</b> and <b>J</b> are probably from stall-prints, and
it has not been thought necessary to notice
some things which may have been put into
these to eke them out to a convenient length.
<b>J</b> has an entirely spurious supplement.
When the pair are riding away, and even as
the wife is protesting her affection, Geordie
turns round and says, A finger of Bignet’s
lady’s hand is worth a’ your fair body. A dispute
ensues, and Geordie pulls out a dagger
and stabs his lady; he then takes to flight,
and never is found. Another set, mentioned
by Motherwell, makes Geordie drown his
deliverer in the sea, in a fit of jealousy
(Minstrelsy, p. lxxvi, 46).</p>

<p class='c011'>There is an English broadside ballad, on
the death of “George Stoole” which seemed
to Motherwell “evidently imitated from the
Scottish song.” This was printed by H. Gosson,
whose time is put at 1607–41.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c017'><sup>[91]</sup></a> This
ballad was to be sung “to a delicate Scottish
tune;” Georgy comes in as a rhyme at the
end of stanzas not seldom; Georgy writes to
his lady, bewailing his folly; he never stole
no oxe nor cow, nor ever murdered any, but
fifty horse he did receive of a merchant’s man
of Gory, for which he was condemned to die,
and did die. These are the data for determining
the question of imitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a later ‘Georgy’ ballad, of the
same general cast, on the life and death of
“George of Oxford,” a professed and confessed
highwayman, a broadside printed in
the last quarter of the seventeenth century.
In this, Lady Gray hastens to Newcastle to
beg Georgy’s life of the judge, and offers gold
and land to save him, after the fashion of
Lady Ward in ‘Hughie Graham;’ to no purpose,
as in ‘Hughie Graham.’ This Georgy
owns and boasts himself a thief, but with limitations
much the same as those which are
made a point of by the other; he never stole
horse, mare, or cloven-foot, with one exception—the
king’s white steeds, which he sold
to Bohemia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both of these ballads are given in an appendix.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether the writers of these English ballads
knew of the Scottish ‘Geordie,’ I would
not undertake to affirm or deny; it is clear
that some far-back reciter of the Scottish
ballad had knowledge of the later English
broadside. The English ballads, however,
are mere “goodnights.” The Scottish ballads
have a proper story, with a beginning, middle,
and end, and (save one late copy), a good
end, and they are most certainly original and
substantially independent of the English.
The Scottish Geordie is no thief, nor even a
Johnie Armstrong. There are certain passages
in certain versions which give that impression,
it is true, but these are incongruous
with the story, and have been adopted
from some copy of the broadside, the later
rather than the earlier. These are, the first
two stanzas of <b>F</b>, utterly out of place, where
we have the king’s horses stolen and sold
in Bohemia, almost exactly as in the ballad
of ‘George of Oxford,’ 15; <b>G</b> 7, where
the Earl of Cassilis is made to steal geldings
and sell them in Balleny; and <b>J</b> 23, in which
the Laird of Gight steals one of the king’s
steeds (precisely as in ‘George of Oxford’)
and sells it in Bevany. That is to say, we
have the very familiar case of the introduction
(generally accidental and often infelicitous)
of a portion of one ballad into another; which,
if accidental in the present instance, would
easily be accounted for by a George being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the hero in each. Further; the burden of <b>E</b>,
embodied in the ballad in two versions, <b>I</b> 27,
<b>J</b> 35, has a general resemblance to that of
‘George Stoole,’ and could hardly have been
original with the Scottish ballad. There was
probably a ‘Geordie Luklie,’ a Scottish variety

slight variations) into a MS. at Abbotsford,
‘Scottish Songs,’ fol. 68 (1795–1806). The
first half is printed from notes of Scott in
Laing’s edition of Sharpe’s Ballad Book, pp.
143, 156 f, and to these two stanzas, nearly
as here printed, there are added in the second
case, p. 157, the following verses, which are
evidently modern, with the exception of the
last:</p>

      <div class='line'>His croft is unshorn, and his meadow grows green.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Scott subjoins, “I never heard more of this.”
He was familiar with Herd’s MSS.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>C</b>, like many things in the Scotish Minstrel,
has passed through editorial hands, whence
the ‘never return’ of st. 4, and ‘A plume in
his helmet, a sword at his knee,’ st. 5. This
copy furnished the starting point for Allan
Cunningham, III, 1, who, however, substitutes
Finlay’s ‘wife’ for the Minstrel’s ‘bryde,’ and
presents her with three bairns.</p>

<p class='c011'>Motherwell made up his ‘Bonnie George
Campbell’ (Minstrelsy, p. 44) from <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>.
In a manuscript copied out by a granddaughter
of Lord Woodhouselee (1840–50), <b>D</b> is combined
with Cunningham’s ballad.</p>

<p class='c011'>Motherwell says that this ballad “is probably
a lament for one of the adherents of the
house of Argyle who fell in the battle of
Glenlivet, stricken on Thursday, the third day
of October, 1594.” Sir Robert Gordon observes
that Argyle lost in this battle his two
cousins, Archibald and James Campbell: Genealogical
History of Sutherland, p. 229. Maidment,
Scotish Ballads, 1868, I, 240, chooses to
think that “there can be little doubt” that
the ballad refers to the murder of Sir John
Campbell of Calder by one of his own surname,
in 1591, and alters the title accordingly
to ‘Bonnie John Campbell.’ Motherwell
has at least a name to favor his supposition.
But Campbells enow were killed, in
battle or feud, before and after 1590, to forbid
a guess as to an individual James or George
grounded upon the slight data afforded by the
ballad.</p>

<p class='c011'>Motherwell’s ballad is translated by Wolff,
Halle der Völker, I, 79, Hausschatz, p. 225.</p>

<p class='c010'>No copy of this ballad earlier than the last
century is known to me. The Museum Catalogue
gives a conjectural date of 1740 to <b>a</b>
and of 1720 to <b>b</b>, and, conjecturally again, assigns
both to Newcastle. <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>e</b> are also without
date. <b>c</b> may be as old as <b>b</b>; <b>d</b>, <b>e</b> are at
least not old, and <b>f</b> is of this century. The
ballad was given under the title ‘Græme and
Bewick,’ in Scott’s Minstrelsy, 1803, III, 93,
“from the recitation of a gentleman” who remembered
it but imperfectly. In a succeeding
edition, III, 66, 1833, deficiencies were
partly supplied and some different readings
adopted “from a copy obtained by the recitation
of an ostler in Carlisle.” The first copy
(entitled ‘Chirstie Græme’) was sent Scott
by William Laidlaw, January 3, 1803 (Letters,
vol. i, No 78), as taken down by him
from the singing of Mr Walter Grieve, in
Craik, on Borthwick Water. It is preserved
in “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,”
No 89, Abbotsford (<b>h</b>); and in the
same volume, No 145, is what is shown by
internal evidence to be the ostler’s copy (<b>g</b>).
Both copies were indisputably derived from
print, though <b>h</b> may have passed through several
mouths. <b>g</b> agrees with <b>b-f</b> closely as to
minute points of phraseology which it is difficult
to believe that a reciter would have retained.
It looks more like an immediate,
though faulty, transcript from print. Of
many deviations, though most may be charge-able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to a bad copyist, or, if one pleases, a bad
memory, others indicate an original which differed
in some particulars from <b>b-f</b>; and the
same may perhaps be true of <b>h</b>, which is, however,
of only very trifling value.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c017'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>‘The Brothers-in-Arms,’ Maidment, Scotish
Ballads and Songs, 1868, II, 150, is Scott’s
later copy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Graham and old Bewick are drinking
together at Carlisle. Graham proposes the
health of their respective sons. Bewick demurs.
Young Graham is no peer for young
Bewick, who is good at both books and arms,
whereas Graham is no scholar. Old Graham
goes home mortified and angry, repeats to his
son Christy what Bewick had said, and bids
him, as he would have his blessing, prove that
he can at least hold his own in a fight with
young Bewick. Christy is ‘faith and troth,’
or sworn-brother, to young Bewick, and begs his
father to forbear. The father insists; Christy
may make his choice, to fight with young Bewick
or with himself. Christy, upon reflection,
concludes that it would be a less crime to
kill his sworn-brother than to kill his father,
but swears that, should it be his lot to kill his
friend, he will never come home alive. He
arms himself and goes to seek his comrade.
Bewick, who has been teaching his five scholars
their fence, and apparently also their
psalms, is walking in his father’s close, with
his sword under his arm, and sees a man
in armor riding towards him. Recognizing
Graham, he welcomes him affectionately.
Graham informs him that he has come to
fight with him, rehearses the scene with old
Graham, and puts by all his friend’s remonstrances
and the suggestion that the fathers
may be reconciled through arbitrators. Forced
to fight, Bewick vows, as Graham had done,
that, if it be his fortune to kill his brother, he
will never go home alive. Graham throws off
his armor that he may have no advantage;
they fight two hours with no result, and then
Graham gives Bewick one of those ‘ackward’
strokes which have determined several duels
in foregoing ballads. The wound is deadly;
Bewick intreats Graham to fly the country;
Graham swears that his vow shall be kept,
leaps on his sword and is the first to die. Old
Bewick comes up and is disposed to congratulate
his son on his victory. Young Bewick
begs him to make one grave for both, and to
lay young Graham on the sunny side, for he
had been the better man. The two fathers
indulge in exclamations of grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>I am persuaded that there was an older and
better copy of this ballad than those which
are extant. The story is so well composed,
proportion is so well kept, on the whole, that
it is reasonable to suppose that certain passages
(as stanzas 3, 4, 50) may have suffered
some injury. There are also phrases which
are not up to the mark of the general style,
as the hack-rhymester lines at 7<sup>3</sup>, 19<sup>2</sup>. But
it is a fine-spirited ballad as it stands, and
very infectious.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ballad is remarkable,” observes Sir
Walter Scott, “as containing probably the
very latest allusion to the institution of brotherhood
in arms.” And he goes on to say: “The
quarrel of the two old chieftains over their
wine is highly in character. Two generations
have not elapsed [1803] since the custom of
drinking deep and taking deadly revenge for
slight offences produced very tragical events
on the border; to which the custom of going
armed to festive meetings contributed not a
little.”</p>

<b>A</b> 1<sup>1,2</sup>, 2 nearly, are found in No 213, ‘Sir
James the Rose,’ 4<sup>1,2</sup>, 5, where also there is a
treacherous leman.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>B.</b> The ‘new-come darling’ of the Duke
of Athole offers the duke’s nurse a ring if she
will carry a word to her leman. This leman
had previously been the nurse’s lover, and
comes to tell her that another has now possession
of his heart. The nurse plans revenge,
but dissimulates; she tells the faithless fellow
to go for the night to an ale-house, and she
will meet him there in the morning. But instead
of the nurse he sees a band of men, her
seven brothers (nine brothers, <b>F</b>), coming
towards the house, and easily divines that
they are come to slay him. He appeals to the
landlady to save him; she dresses him in
woman’s clothes and sets him to her baking.
The seven brothers ask the landlady if she
had a lodger last night; they are come to pay
his reckoning. A lodger had been there, but
he did not stay till morning. They search the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>house and stab the beds, often passing the
sham baking-maid without detecting the disguise.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>C-F</b> have nothing about the ‘new-come
darling,’ but begin at once with the nurse,
who longs for her lover, and would give her
half-year’s fee to see him. He appears, and
avows to her that another woman has gained
his heart.</p>

1780, Abbotsford library. <b>b.</b> Motherwell’s Minstrelsy,
p. 321. <b>c.</b> Sir James the Rose’s Garland,
one of a volume of the like from Heber’s library.
<b>d.</b> Motherwell’s MS., p. 281; from the recitation of

The same, II, 42. <b>g.</b> ‘Sir James the Rose,’ Pinkerton’s
Scottish Tragic Ballads, 1781, p. 61.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>b</b>, says Motherwell, “is given as it occurs
in early stall-prints, and as it is to be obtained
from the recitations of elderly people.”
Most of the variations are derived from <b>d</b>.
<b>c</b> may have been printed earlier than <b>a</b>, but
is astonishingly faulty. <b>d</b>, well remembered
from print, is what Motherwell meant by
“the recitations of elderly people.” <b>e</b> was obtained
by Herd, probably from recitation, as
early as 1776, but must have been learned
from print. <b>f</b> is <b>e</b> with a few missing lines
supplied. <b>g</b>, says Pinkerton, “is given from
a modern edition in one sheet 12mo,” but was
beyond question considerably manipulated by
the editor. All the important variations are
certainly his work.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>The copy in Buchan’s Gleanings, p. 9, is <b>g</b>.
Whitelaw, in his Book of Scotish Ballads, p.
39, has combined <b>b</b> and <b>g</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Half a dozen lines preserved by Burns,
Cromek’s Select Scotish Songs, II, 196 (see
the preface to No 212), seem to belong to
this ballad.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Sir James the Ross, A Historical Ballad’
(sometimes called ‘The Buchanshire Tragedy’),
was composed by the youthful Michael
Bruce ([+] 1767) upon the story of the popular
ballad, and has perhaps enjoyed more
favor with “the general” than the original.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c017'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
‘Elfrida and Sir James of Perth,’ Caw’s Poetical
Museum, 1784, p. 290 (probably taken,
as most of the pieces are by the collector said
to be, from some periodical publication), looks
more like an imitation of Bruce’s ballad than
of its prototype. It is in fact a stark plagiarism.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir James the Rose has killed a squire, and
men are out to take him. A nurse at the
house of Marr is his leman, and he resorts to
her in the hope that she may befriend him.
She advises him to go to an ale-house for the
night, promising to meet him there in the
morning; he says he will do so, but, perhaps
from distrust, which proves to be well
grounded, prefers to wrap himself in his plaid
and sleep under the sky. The party sent
out to take him question the nurse, who at
first makes a deceptive answer, then gives
them a direction to his hiding-place. They
find James the Rose asleep and take away his
arms; he wakes and begs for mercy, and is
told that he shall have such as he has given.
He appeals to his servant to stay by him till
death, and then to take his body to Loch
Largan (Loughargan), for which service the
man shall have his clothes and valuables. The
avengers cut out his heart and take it to his
leman at the house of Marr; she raves over her
treachery, and is ‘born away’ bodily, to be
seen no more.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>e</b>, <b>f</b>, it may be by accident, lack the vulgar
passage 18, 19, which may be a later addition,
for nothing is said of a man being in
attendance when Sir James goes to his lair.
The leader of the band that takes Sir James
the Rose is Sir James the Graham, Sir James
Graham, in <b>c</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>f</b>; a simple error, evidently.
No motive is furnished in <b>a-f</b> for the woman’s
betraying her leman. <b>g</b> makes her offer information
on condition of getting a proper
reward, and she is promised Sir James’s purse
and brechan, but in the end is tendered his
bleeding heart and his bleeding tartan, whatever
that may be other than his brechan.
This must be one of Pinkerton’s improvements.
The moral tag, st. 24, is dropped, or
wanting, in <b>c</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The topography of traditional ballads frequently
presents difficulties, both because it
is liable to be changed, wholly, or, what is
more embarrassing, partially, to suit a locality
to which a ballad has been transported, and
again because unfamiliar names, when not exchanged,
are exposed to corruption. Some of
the places, also, have not a dignity which entitles
them to notice in gazetteers. The first
point, in the case before us, would be to settle
the whereabouts of the House of Marr, in the
vicinity of which the scene is laid. This I
am unable to do. There is a Ballechin in Logierait
Parish, Perthshire. There is said to
be a Baleichan in Forfarshire.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c017'><sup>[94]</sup></a> It is not easy
to see why the heir of either of these places
(Buleighan and the rest may stand for either)
should wish to have his body taken to Loch
Largon in Invernesshire, if Loch Largon
means Loch Laggan, as seems likely.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c017'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'><b>P.</b> Cromek’s Select Scotish Songs, 1810, II, 196; two
stanzas.</p>

<p class='c010'>First published in Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border, 1803 (<b>E b</b>). Scott remarks that
he “found it easy to collect a variety of copies,
but very difficult indeed to select from them
such a collated edition as might in any degree
suit the taste of ‘these more light and giddy-paced
times.’” The copy principally used
was <b>E a</b>. St. 12 of Scott, which suited the
taste of the last century, but does not suit with
a popular ballad, is from <b>O</b>, and also st. 13,
and there are traces of <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>M</b>, but 5–7 have
lines which do not occur in any version that I
have seen.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A</b> had been somewhat edited before it was
communicated to Percy; the places were,
however, indicated by commas. Several copies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>besides <b>O</b>, already referred to, have slight
passages that never came from the unsophisticated
people; as <b>J</b> 2, in which a page “runs
with sorrow,” for rhyme and without reason,
<b>L</b> 2<sup>3</sup>, and <b>L</b> 12<sup>3,4</sup>, which is manifestly taken
from Logan’s Braes of Yarrow.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c017'><sup>[96]</sup></a> <b>N</b> has been
interpolated with artificial nonsense,<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c017'><sup>[97]</sup></a> and is
an almost worthless copy; the last stanza
may defy competition for silliness.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>M</b> 1, 3, and <b>N</b> 4, 6, 7, belong to ‘The
Duke of Athole’s Nurse.’ So also does one
half of a fragment sent by Burns in a letter to
William Tytler, Cromek’s Select Scotish
Songs, 1810, II, 194–8, which, however, has
two stanzas of this ballad (<b>P</b>) and two of
‘Rare Willie’s drowned in Yarrow,’ No 215.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fragment in Ritson’s Scotish Songs,
1794, I, lxvii, is <b>O</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Herd’s MSS, I, 36, II, 182, have the following
couplets, evidently from a piece treating
the story of this ballad:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O when I look east my heart is sair,</div>
      <div class='line'>But when I look west it’s mair and mair,</div>
      <div class='line'>For there I see the braes of Yarrow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there I lost for ay my marrow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The groups <b>A-I</b> and <b>J-P</b> are distinguished
by the circumstance, of no importance to the
story, that the hero and heroine in the former
are man and wife, in the other unmarried
lovers. In all the versions (leaving out of
account the fragments <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>) the family of the
woman are at variance with the man. Her
brothers think him an unfit match for their
sister, <b>A</b> 8, <b>B</b> 2.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c017'><sup>[98]</sup></a> In <b>C</b> 2 the brothers have
taken offence because their sister was not regarded
as his equal by her husband, which is
perhaps too much of a refinement for ballads,
and may be a perversion. She was worth
stealing in <b>C</b> as in <b>B</b>. The dispute in two or
three copies appears to take the form who is
the flower, or rose, of Yarrow, that is the best
man, <b>C</b> 8, 9, 17, <b>B</b> 1, 12, <b>D</b> 1, 14; but this
matter is muddled, cf. <b>C</b> 2, 3, <b>D</b> 2. We hear
nothing about the unequal match in <b>D</b>-<b>I</b>, but
in <b>J-L</b> a young lady displeases her father by
refusing nine gentlemen in favor of a servant-lad.</p>

<p class='c011'>Men who are drinking together fall out and
set a combat for the next day, <b>B-F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>. It
is three lords that drink and quarrel in <b>B</b>-<b>D</b>
(ten (?) in <b>I</b>). The lady fears that her three
brothers will slay her husband, <b>B</b> 5, <b>C</b> 5. The
lord in <b>D</b> 2 seems not to be one of the three
in <b>D</b> 1, and we are probably to understand
that three brothers get into a brawl with a
man who has surreptitiously married their
sister. Only one brother is spoken of in <b>A</b> (6),
from whom treachery is looked for, <b>E</b> 2.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>I-L</b> the father makes the servant-lad
fight with the nine high-born suitors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wife tries to keep her husband at home,
<b>A-E</b>, <b>I</b>; but he is confident that all will go
well, and that he shall come back to her early,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>I</b>. She kisses (washes) and combs
him, and helps to arm him, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>;
so <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c017'><sup>[99]</sup></a> He finds nine armed men awaiting
him on the braes or houms of Yarrow, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>-<b>G</b>,
<b>I-M</b>, ten <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c017'><sup>[100]</sup></a> They ask if he has come to
hawk, hunt (drink), or fight; he replies that
he has come to fight, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>; cf. <b>A</b> 5, 6. Five
(four) he slays and four (five) he wounds,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>; in <b>F</b> he kills all the nine;
in <b>L</b> he gets no further than the seventh; in
<b>G</b> he kills all but one.</p>

<p class='c011'>These nine, after the way of ballads, should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>be the lady’s brothers, and such they are in
<b>A</b> 7, 8. Three of them, but only three, should
be the lady’s brothers according to <b>B</b> 1–5,
<b>C</b> 1–5. Three brethren are charged by the
husband with a message to his lady in <b>D</b> 8,
and these might be his brothers-in-law. The
message is sent in <b>E</b> 9 by a good-brother, or
wife’s brother, John, who clearly was not in
the fight in <b>E</b>, though the husband says he is
going to meet this brother John in <b>A</b> 6. This
brother-in-law of <b>E</b> is probably intended by
brother in <b>I</b> 8.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the hero has successively disposed of
his nine or ten antagonists (he takes them
‘man for man’), he is stabbed from behind
in a cowardly way, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, by
somebody. The tradition is much blurred
here; it is a squire out of the bush, a cowardly
man, a fause lord. An Englishman
shoots him with an arrow out of a bush in <b>D</b>.
But other reports are distinct. The lady’s
father runs him through (not from behind) in
<b>J</b>, <b>K</b>. Her brother springs from a bush behind
and runs him through, <b>L</b>. Her brother
John comes behind him and slays him, <b>N</b>.
Up and rose her brother James and slew
him, <b>M</b>. In <b>E</b> “that stubborn knight” comes
behind him and runs his body through, and
that (a) “stubborn lord” is the author of
his death in <b>G</b>, <b>F</b>. Taking <b>E</b> 2, 8, 9 together,
the stubborn knight, at least in <b>E</b>, may be interpreted
as good-brother John, whose treachery
is feared in <b>E</b> 2, who is prominent in <b>A</b> 6,
and who is expressly said to slay his sister’s
true-love in <b>N</b>. On the whole, the preponderance
of tradition is to the effect that the hero
was treacherously slain by his wife’s (love’s)
brother.</p>

<p class='c011'>Word of her husband’s death is sent or carried
to the wife by her brother, brother John,
<b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>; her or his three brothers, <b>D</b> 8;
her or his brother, <b>I</b> 8; his man John, <b>C</b> 12,
by mistake; her father (?), <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>; her sister
Anne, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. The wife has had a dream
that she, her lord or true-love and she, had
been pulling green heather (birk) in Yarrow,
<b>A</b>, <b>C-F</b>, <b>I-M</b>, <b>O</b>.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c017'><sup>[101]</sup></a> The dream is explained
to signify her lord’s death, and she is enjoined
to fetch him home. In <b>A</b>, the dream
occurs before the fight and is double, of pulling
green heather and of her love coming
headless home; in <b>B</b>, the lady dreams that her
lord was sleeping sound in Yarrow, and in the
highly vitiated <b>N</b> that ‘he had lost his life.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The wife hurries to Yarrow;<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c017'><sup>[102]</sup></a> up a high,
high hill and down into the valley, where she
sees nine (ten) dead men, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>M</b> (nine
well-armed men, wrongly, <b>H</b>).<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c017'><sup>[103]</sup></a> She sees her
true-love lying slain, finds him sleeping sound,
in Yarrow, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>. She kisses him and
combs his hair, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>; she
drinks the blood that runs from him, <b>E</b> 12,
<b>F</b> 11, <b>G</b> 7, <b>M</b> 9.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c017'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Her hair is five quarters long; she twists it
round his hand and draws him home, <b>C</b>; ties
it round his middle and carries him home, <b>D</b>.
She takes three lachters of her hair, ties them
tight round his middle and carries him home,
<b>B</b>. <i>His</i> hair is five quarters long! she ties it
to her horse’s mane and trails him home, <b>K</b>.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c017'><sup>[105]</sup></a>
The carrying strikes one as unpractical, the
trailing as barbarous. In <b>L</b>, after the lover is
slain, the surviving lords and her brother trail
him by the heels to Yarrow water and throw
him into a whirlpool. The lady, searching for
him, sees him ‘deeply drowned.’ His hair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>which we must suppose to float, is five quarters
long; she twines it round her hand and
draws him out. Raising no petty questions, it
appears enough to say that this is the only version
of fourteen in which the drowning occurs,
and that the drowning of the lover is the characteristic
of No 215, the next following ballad,
which has otherwise been partly confused with
this.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c017'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The lady’s father urges her to restrain her
grief; he will wed her with as good a lord as
she has lost, or a better; she rejects his suggestions.
Her heart breaks, <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>; she dies
in her father’s arms, <b>D</b>, <b>F-H</b>, <b>J-L</b>, being at
the time big with child, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F-H</b>, <b>J</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady tells her father to wed his sons, <b>B</b>
12; his seven sons, <b>J</b> 18. So ‘Clerk Saunders’
(of which this may be a reminiscence,
for we do not hear of seven sons in this ballad),
No 69, <b>G</b> 28; cf. <b>A</b> 26, <b>E</b> 19.</p>

<p class='c011'>She bids him take home his ousen and his
kye, <b>E</b> 15, <b>F</b> 12, <b>G</b> 8, <b>H</b> 9. This I conceive
to be an interpolation by a reciter who followed
the tradition cited from Hogg further on.</p>

<p class='c011'>The message to the mother to come take up
her son in <b>I</b> 8 may possibly be a reminiscence
from ‘Johnie Cock,’ No 114. It occurs in no
other copy, and comes in awkwardly.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The Braes of Yarrow’ (‘Busk ye, busk ye,
my bony, bony bride’), written by William
Hamilton of Bangour “in imitation of the
ancient Scottish manner,’ was suggested by
this ballad.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c017'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>‘The Dowy Dens,’ Evans’s Old Ballads,
1810, III, 342, has the same foundation.
‘The Haughs o Yarrow,’ a modern piece in
Buchan’s Ballads of the North of Scotland,
II, 211, repeats with a slight change the third
stanza of <b>O</b>, and has further on half a stanza
from ‘Willie’s rare,’ No 215.</p>

<p class='c011'>James Hogg, in sending <b>E</b> a to Sir Walter
Scott, wrote as follows: “Tradition placeth
the event on which this song is founded very
early. That the song hath been written near
the time of the transaction appears quite evident,
although, like others, by frequent singing
the language is become adapted to an age
not so far distant. The bard does not at all
relate particulars, but only mentions some
striking features of a tragical event which
everybody knew. This is observable in many
of the productions of early times; at least the
secondary bards seem to have regarded their
songs as purely temporary.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The hero of the ballad is said to have been
of the name of Scott, and is called a knight of
great bravery. He lived in Ettrick, some say
at Oakwood, others Kirkhope; but was treacherously
slain by his brother-in-law, as related
in the ballad, who had him at ill will because
his father had parted with the half of all his
goods and gear to his sister on her marriage
with such a respectable man. The name of
the murderer is said to be Annand, a name I
believe merely conjectural from the name of
the place where they are said both to be buried,
which at this day is called Annan’s Treat,
a low muir lying to the west of Yarrow church,
where two huge tall stones are erected, below
which the least child that can walk the road
will tell you the two lords are buried that
were slain in a duel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Walter Scott, in the revised edition of
his Minstrelsy, expressed a conviction that
this ballad referred to a duel fought between
John Scott of Tushielaw and his brother-in-law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Walter Scott of Thirlestane, in which
the latter was slain.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c017'><sup>[108]</sup></a> Contemporary entries
in the records of the Presbytery of Selkirk
show that John Scott, son to Walter of Tushielaw,
killed Walter Scott, brother of Sir
Robert of Thirlestane, in 1609. The slain
Walter Scott was not, however, the brother-in-law
of John of Tushielaw, for his wife was
a daughter of Sir Patrick Porteous. A violent
feud ensued, as might be expected, between
the Scotts of Thirlestane and of Tushielaw.
Seven years later, in 1616, a Walter Scott of
Tushielaw made “an informal and inordinat
marriage with Grizel Scott of Thirlestane
without consent of her father.” The record
of the elopement is three months after followed
by an entry of a summons to Simeon
Scott of Bonytoun (an adherent of Thirlestane)
and three other Scotts “to compear in Melrose
to hear themselves excommunicat for the horrible
slaughter of Walter Scott” [of Tushielaw].
Disregarding the so-called duel, we
have a Walter Scott of Tushielaw carrying off
a wife from the Scotts of Thirlestane, with
which family he was at feud; and a Walter
Scott of Tushielaw horribly slaughtered by
Scotts of Thirlestane. These facts correspond
rather closely with the incidents of the ballad.
We do not know, to be sure, that the
two Walter Scotts of Tushielaw were the same
person. There were Walter Scotts many; but
tradition is capable of confounding the two or
the three connected with this series of events.
On the other hand, there is nothing in the
ballad to connect it preferably with the
Scotts; the facts are such as are likely to
have occurred often in history, and a similar
story is found in other ballads.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the Scandinavian ballad ‘Herr Helmer,’
Helmer has married a lady whose family are
at feud with him for the unatoned slaughter
of her uncle; he meets her seven brothers,
who will now hear of no satisfaction; there is
a fight; Helmer kills six, but spares the
seventh, who treacherously kills him: Afzelius,
ed. Bergström, I, 264, Arwidsson, I, 155
(etc., see II, 170 of this collection, note ‡).
Other forms make the last of the brothers
willing to accept an arrangement: ‘Herr Helmer
Blau,’ Danske Viser, IV, 251, No 209,
‘Herr Hjælm,’ Grundtvig, Danske Folkeminder,
1861, p. 81. ‘Jomfruen i Skoven,’ Danske
Viser, III, 99, No 123, has also several features
of our ballad. The hero, on parting
from a lady with whom he has passed the
night in a wood, is warned by her to avoid
her seven brothers. This he is too brave to do,
and he meets them. They ask him where are
his hawk and his hound. He tries, unsuccessfully,
to induce them to give him their sister
for wife; they fight; he kills all the seven
brothers, and is slain himself, in some way not
explained. (These ballads are translated in
Prior, III, 371, 230.)</p>

Songs, 1810, II, 196, sent by Burns in a letter
to William Tytler, 1790, belongs, as already
said, mostly with ‘The Duke of Athole’s
Nurse,’ but has two stanzas of ‘Willie drowned
in Yarrow’ (<b>B</b>).</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The Braes of Yarrow,’ Ritson’s Scotish
Song, I, 154, composed upon the story of this
ballad by the Rev. John Logan (1748–88),
has two of the original lines (nearly):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>

      <div class='line'>They sought him east, they sought him west,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They sought him all the forest thorough.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Willie is drowned in Yarrow according to
the older (southern) tradition, <b>A</b>; also <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>.
In the northern copies, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, with which <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, agree, the scene is transferred to Gamrie, on
the coast of the Moray Frith, where, as Christie
remarks, “there is no water that Willie could
have been drowned in but the sea, on his way
along the sands to the old kirk.”<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c017'><sup>[109]</sup></a> In the
ballad which follows this, a western variety
of the same story, Willie is drowned in the
Clyde.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>C</b> 2, 3, 5, 6, belong to the preceding ballad,
and 4 is common to that and this.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A</b> 2 would come in better at the end of
the story (as it does in <b>C</b>, a copy of slight
authority), if it might properly find a place
anywhere in the ballad. But this stanza suits
only a woman who has been for some time
living with her husband. A woman on her
wedding-day could have no call to make her
bed broad in her mother’s house, whether
yestreen or the morrow. I therefore conclude
that <b>A</b> 2 does not belong to this ballad.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c017'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span><b>D-H.</b> Rare Willie has promised to marry
Meggie, <b>E</b> (also <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>). His mother would
give her the wale of all her other sons, but
not Willie; she will have him only; <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>
(cf. <b>G</b> 1). The bridegroom, with a large
company, is mounted to ride for the bride; he
tells his friends to go forward, he has forgotten
to ask his mother’s blessing; <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>. He
receives the blessing, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>; her blessing
goes not with him, <b>G</b>; he gets her heavy
curse, <b>E</b>; even in <b>F</b> his mother, after giving
her blessing, says that he will never see his
wedding. (The mother’s curse is the characteristic
feature of the next following ballad.)
The bridal party come to the river, or burn,
of Gamrie; all the others pass the stream
safely, but Willie is washed from his saddle,
<b>D-H</b>. The rest ride on to the kirk of Gamrie.
The bride asks where is the man who was to
marry her, and is told that Willie is drowned.
She tears the ribbons from her hair and runs
to the river, plunges in, and finds Willie in the
deepest pot, the middle, the deepest weil. She
will make her bed with him in Gamrie; both
mothers shall be alike sorry; <b>D-G</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>H</b>, Willie’s horse comes home with an
empty saddle. His mother is sure that her son
is dead; her daughter tries in vain to persuade
her that all is well; Meggie takes her lover’s
body from the river and lays it on the grass;
she will sleep with him in the same grave at
Gamrie.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, the drowned body is found in the
cleft of a rock, the clifting or clintin of a
craig; in <b>C</b> 4 neath a buss of brume, that
stanza belonging, as most of the copy does,
to the preceding ballad; cf. <b>J</b> 14, <b>K</b> 11 of No
214. The bride ties three links of her hair,
which is three quarters long, round Willie’s
waist, and draws him out of the water, <b>B</b> 2,
<b>C</b> 5; for the hair, cf. No 214, where also it is
not advantageously used. The bride’s tearing
the ribbons from her head, <b>D</b> 12, <b>E</b> 15, <b>F</b> 8,
<b>G</b> 7, <b>H</b> 14, is found also in No 214, <b>D</b> 11, <b>I</b> 12,
but is inappropriate there. A brother, brother
John, whether the man’s or the woman’s, tells
the bad news in No 214, <b>A</b> 11, <b>E</b> 9, <b>I</b> 8, <b>L</b> 11,
<b>N</b> 9, 10, as here <b>D</b> 11, <b>E</b> 14, <b>F</b> 7, <b>G</b> 6, <b>H</b> 13.</p>

<h3 class='c023'>APPENDIX</h3>

<h4 class='c037'>ANNAN WATER</h4>

<p class='c040'>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, 1833, III, 282; 1802,
II, 138.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first edition lacks stanzas 5, 6, 8, 9. Two
of these were inserted “from another copy of the
ballad in which the conclusion proves fortunate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ballad,” says Scott, “is given from tradition,”
for which a more precise expression would perhaps
be “oral repetition.” It is asserted in the
Minstrelsy to be “the original words of the tune of
‘Allan Water,’ by which name the song is mentioned
in Ramsay’s Tea-Table Miscellany” (‘Allan Water,
or, My love Annie’s very bonny,’ T. T. M., vol. i,
p. 105, of the Dublin edition of 1729). This assertion
is not justified by any reasons, nor does it seem
pertinent, if the Allan was originally the river of
the ballad, to add, as the editor does, that “the
Annan and the Frith of Solway, into which it falls,
are the frequent scenes of tragical accidents.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A song which may pass for the original Allan
Water until an earlier is produced is among the
Laing broadsides (now in the possession of Lord
Rosebery), No 59. There is no date or place, but it
is thought to have been printed toward the end of
the seventeenth century, or the beginning of the
eighteenth, and probably at Edinburgh.</p>

<p class='c011'>The title is: ‘Allan Water, or, A Lover in Captivity.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c017'><sup>[111]</sup></a>
A new song, sung with a pleasant new
air.’ There are three eight-line stanzas, and it begins:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Allan Water’s wide and deep,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>and my dear Anny’s very bonny;</div>
      <div class='line'>Wide’s the straith that lyes above ‘t,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>if ‘t were mine, I’de give it all for Anny.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Allan Cunningham says of the ballad, Songs of
Scotland, II, 102: “I have heard it sung on the
banks of the Annan. Like all traditional verses,
there are many variations.” And he cites as “from
an old fragment” these couplets:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O Annan water’s wading deep, [<i>i.e.</i> wide and]</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet I am loth to weet my feet;</div>
      <div class='line'>But if ye’ll consent to marry me,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll hire a horse to carry thee.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c017'><sup>[112]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is my conviction that ‘Anna Water,’ in Ramsay’s
language, is one of the “Scots poems wrote
by the ingenious before” 1800.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the Gatehope Slack,” says Sir Walter
Scott, “is perhaps meant the Gate Slack, a pass
in Annandale.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'><b>A.</b> ‘Clyde’s Water,’ Skene MS., p. 50.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> ‘Willie and May Margaret,’ Jamieson’s Popular
Ballads, 1806, I, 135.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>C.</b> ‘The Drowned Lovers,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the
North of Scotland, I, 140; ‘Willie and Margaret,’
Motherwell’s MS., p. 611; printed in part in Motherwell’s
Minstrelsy, Appendix, p. iii.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stanzas 1, 5, 6, 7, 16, of <b>B</b> were printed by
Jamieson (under the title of Sweet Willie and
May Margaret) in the Scots Magazine, October,
1803, p. 700, in the hope of obtaining a
complete copy.</p>

<p class='c011'>In notes to <b>B</b> are here given some various
readings and supplementary verses which
were entered by Motherwell in a copy of his
Minstrelsy, without indication of their origin.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c017'><sup>[113]</sup></a>
Motherwell made a few changes in transcribing
<b>C</b> into his MS., and others in the verses
which he printed in the appendix to his Minstrelsy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The copy of this ballad in Nimmo’s Songs
and Ballads of Clydesdale, p. 134, was compounded
from <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Willie orders his horse and his man to be
fed, for he means to be that very night with
his love Margaret. His mother would have
him stay with her: he shall have the best bed
in the house and the best hen in the roost, <b>A</b>;
the best cock in the roost and the best sheep
in the flock, <b>B</b>; a sour wind is blowing and
the night will be dark, <b>C</b>. He cares for
none of these, and will go. My malison
drown thee in Clyde! says his mother. Clyde
is roaring fearfully, but he wins through.
Arrived at Margaret’s bower, he tirls at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>pin and calls to her to open. A voice asks,
Who is there? It is her lover, his boots full
of Clyde’s water. An answer comes, as if
from Margaret, that she has no lovers without
and none within, and she will not open, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>;
her mother is fast asleep, and she dares make
no din, <b>B</b>. Then he begs for some shelter for
the night; but is told that one chamber is
full of corn, another full of hay, and the third
full of gentlemen, who will not go till morning.
Farewell, then; he has won his mother’s
malison by coming. Clyde’s water is half
up over the brae, <b>B</b>, and sweeps him off his
horse, <b>C</b>. Margaret wakens from a dreary
dream that her love had been ‘staring’
(standing?) at the foot of her bed, <b>A</b>; had
been at the gates, and nobody would let him
in, <b>C</b>. Her mother informs her that her lover
had really been at the gates but half an hour
before. Margaret instantly gets up and goes
after Willie, crying to him against the loud
wind. She does not stop for the river. No
more was ever seen of Willie but his hat, no
more of Margaret but her comb and her
snood, <b>A</b>, which might end well so, but has
lost a few lines. <b>C</b> ends like the preceding
ballad: Margaret finds Willie in the deepest
pot in Clyde; they shall sleep together in
its bed.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>C</b> 20, 21 absurdly represents Willie’s brother
as standing on the river-bank and expostulating
with him; this in the dead of night.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c017'><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The passage in two of the copies, <b>A</b> 10–16,
<b>C</b> 11–15, 22–25, in which the mother, pretending
to be her daughter, repels the lover, and
the daughter, who has dreamed that her lover
had come and had been refused admittance,
is told by her mother that this had actually
happened, and sets off in pursuit of her lover,
seems to have been adopted from ‘The Lass
of Roch Royal,’ No 76. Parts are exchanged,
as happens not infrequently with ballads; in
the ‘Lass of Roch Royal,’ the lass is turned
away by her lover’s mother, pretending to
speak in his person. There is verbal correspondence,
particularly in <b>A</b> 16; cf. No 76,
<b>D</b> 26, 27, <b>E</b> 22, 23. In <b>D</b> 19 of No 76 the
professed Love Gregor tells Annie that he has
another love, as the professed Meggie in <b>A</b> 11
(inconsistently with what precedes) tells
Willie.</p>

<p class='c011'>The three steps into the water, <b>C</b> 26–28,
occur also in ‘Child Waters,’ No 63, <b>B</b> 7–9,
<b>C</b> 6–8, <b>I</b> 3, 4, 6. Nose-bleed, <b>C</b> 1, is a bad
omen; see No 208.</p>

<p class='c011'>are found in a broadside ‘Tragedy of Hero
and Leander,’ Roxburghe Ballads, III, 152,
etc., of the date, it is thought, of about
1650; Ebsworth’s Roxburghe Ballads, VI,
558, Collier’s Book of Roxburghe Ballads,
1847, p. 227. The conceit does not overwell
suit a popular ballad. The original is Martial’s
Parcite dum propero, mergite cum redeo,
otherwise, Mergite me, fluctus, cum rediturus
ero, Epigr. lib., 25 b, and lib. xiv, 181.</p>

<p class='c011'>A very popular Italian ballad has some of
the traits of ‘The Mother’s Malison,’ parts
being exchanged and the girl drowned. A
girl is asked in marriage; her mother objects,
in most of the copies on the ground of her
daughter’s youth; she goes off with her lover;
the mother wishes that she may drown in the
sea; arrived at the seashore her horse becomes
restive, and the girl is drowned (or she goes
down in mid-sea): ‘Maledizione della Madre,’
Nigra, Canti popolari del Piemonte, p. 151,
No 23 <b>A</b>-<b>F</b>; ‘La Maledizione materna,’ Marcoaldi,
p. 170, No 15; ‘La Maledetta,’ Ferraro,
C. p. monferrini, p. 35, No 27; ‘Buona-sera,
vedovella,’ Ferraro, C. p. del Basso Monferrato,
p. 16, No 7; ‘La Figlia disobbediente,’
Bolza, C. p. comasche, No 55; ‘Amor di
Fratello,’ Bernoni, C. p. veneziani, Puntata 9,
No 4; Righi, C. p. veronesi, p. 30, No 93;
Wolf, Volkslieder aus Venetien, No 92 (a
fragment). In ‘Marinai,’ Ferraro, C. p. di
Ferrara, etc., p. 59, No 9, the suitor is a sailor,
and the girl goes down in his ship, and so in
‘Il marinaro e la sua amorosa,’ No 94, Wolf,
but in this last she is still told to stick to her
horse. A fragment in Marie Aycard’s Bal-lades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>et ch. p. de la Provence, p. xix, repeated
in Arbaud, II, 166, makes it probable that
the Italian ballad was known in the south of
France. (All the above are cited by Count
Nigra.)</p>

<p class='c011'>A mother’s curse upon her son, who is riding
to fetch his bride, results in his breaking
his neck, in a Bohemian ballad already spoken
of under ‘Clerk Colvil,’ No 42; see <b>I</b>, 368
(where a translation by Wenzig, Slawische
Volkslieder, p. 47, might have been noted).</p>

<p class='c011'>A mother refuses to give her daughter in
marriage because the girl is under age; the
daughter is forcibly carried off; the mother
wishes that she may not live a year, which
comes to pass: ‘Der Mutter Fluch,’ Meinert,
p. 246.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>This ballad was widely diffused in Scotland.
“It would be useless,” says Motherwell,
“to enumerate the titles of the different
versions which are common among reciters.”
“Each district has its own version,” says Kinloch.
So it must have done no little mischief
in its day. The earliest known copies, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
are of the second half of the last century.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is an English “ditty” (not a traditional
ballad) of a northern lass who got
harm while milking her father’s ewes, which
was printed in the first half of the seventeenth
century. It is here given in an appendix.
This ditty is “to a pleasant Scotch tune
called The broom of Cowden Knowes,” and
the burden is:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With, O the broome, the bonny broome,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The broome of Cowden Knowes!</div>
      <div class='line'>Fain would I be in the North Countrey,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To milk my dadyes ewes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The tune was remarkably popular, and the
burden is found, variously modified, in connection
with several songs: see Chappell’s
Popular Music, pp. 458–461, 613, 783. ‘The
Broom of Cowdenknows,’ a “new” song, in
the Tea-Table Miscellany, p. 22, Dublin, 1729,
has the burden not greatly changed; also <b>G</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, of this ballad.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is very little story to the English
ditty. A maid is beguiled by a shepherd-boy
while milking her father’s ewes; the consequences
are what might be expected; her
mother puts her out of doors, and she ranges
the world; a young man who hears her complaint
offers to marry her, and go to the North
Country with her to milk her father’s ewes.
The Scottish ballad could not have been developed
from a story of this description. On
the other hand, it is scarcely to be believed
that the author of the English ditty, if he
had known the Scottish ballad, would have
dropped all the interesting particulars. It is
possible that he may have just heard about it,
but much more likely that he knew only the
burden and built his very slight tale on that.
It may be observed that his maid, though she
haunts Liddesdale, and should have belonged
to Cowdenknowes, was born in Danby Forest,
Yorkshire.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two passages which do not occur in <b>A</b> may
have been later additions: <b>D</b> 9, 10, <b>F</b> 5, 6, <b>G</b>
13, 14, <b>M</b> 19, 20, in which the laird, returning
to his men, is told that he has tarried long,
and answers that, east or west, he has never
seen so bonny a lass as was in the ewe-buchts;
and <b>H</b> 12–15, <b>J</b> 2–5, <b>L</b> 5–8, where
the laird tries to pass himself off for one of
his men, and the maid for one of her mother’s
servants (found in part, also, in <b>G</b> 9, 10, <b>I</b> 5,
<b>M</b> 12–14). “The maid of a place, such as
the maid of the Cowdenknows,” as Dr Joseph
Robertson remarks, “means the eldest daughter
of the tenant or proprietor, who is generally
called by the name of his farm.”<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c017'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It is obvious that the maid would keep her
counsel when she came back to her father.
She puts him off with a riddle, <b>C</b> 9, <b>D</b> 13, <b>E</b>
11, <b>F</b> 9, <b>G</b> 18, <b>H</b> 20, <b>J</b> 6, <b>L</b> 14, <b>M</b> 23, <b>N</b> 7,
which it is the height of absurdity to make
her explain, as is done in <b>A</b> 11, <b>B</b> 4, <b>C</b> 10,
<b>D</b> 14, <b>E</b> 12; and so of the exclamation against
the shepherd if uttered in the father’s presence,
as in <b>F</b> 8, <b>H</b> 19, <b>I</b> 11, <b>L</b> 13, <b>N</b> 8.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>H</b> 10, 11 (cf. <b>D</b> 6), where the maid asks the
man’s name, is a familiar commonplace: see
No 39, I, 340 a; No 50, I, 444, 446; No 110,
II, 458 ff. (especially p. 473, <b>H</b> 3, 4); No 111,
II, 478 f.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>M</b> has many spurious stanzas of its own;
as 3–5, 25, 30–32, 35. <b>N</b> is quite perverted
from 9 to 28. It is impossible that 9–14
should follow upon 8, and stanzas 15–27 have
not a genuine word in them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cunningham has rewritten the ballad,
Songs of Scotland, II, 113. He says that
through Dumfriesshire and Galloway the hero
is always Lord Lochinvar, and cites this
stanza, which he had heard sung:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For I do guess, by your golden-rimmed hat,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And by the silken string,</div>
      <div class='line'>That ye are the lord of the Lochinvar,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Who beguiles all our young women.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>‘Malfred og Sadelmand,’ Kristensen, I, 258,
No 99, is an independent ballad, but has some
of the traits of this: the maid, who is treated
with great violence, asks the knight’s name,
as in <b>H</b>, <b>D</b>; he comes back to marry her,
after she has borne twins.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cowdenknowes is on the east bank of
Leader, near Earlston, and some four or five
miles from Melrose. Auchentrone, in <b>B</b> <b>b</b> 11,
Stenhouse conjectures to be a corruption of
Auchentroich, an estate in the county of Stirling,
and Oakland Hills, in <b>G</b>, to be Ochil
Hills, in the same county: Musical Museum,
IV, 112.</p>

<p class='c024'><b>a.</b> Roxburghe Ballads, I, 190, in the Ballad Society’s reprint,
ed. W. Chappell, I, 587. <b>b.</b> Rawlinson Ballads, 566,
fol. 205.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>a</b> <span class='fss'>WAS</span> printed at London for F. Coules, who, according
to Mr Chappell, flourished during the last
five years of James First’s reign and throughout
that of Charles First: dated by Mr Bullen, 1640.
<b>b</b> was printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, and J. Wright,
1655–80 (Chappell). There is another copy in the
Euing collection, No 166, printed for Francis Coles
in the Old Bayly, who may be the same person as
the printer of <b>a</b>; and a fourth in the Douce collection,
II, 137, <i>verso</i>, without printer’s name. A
copy differing from <b>a</b> by only three words is given
by R. H. Evans, Old Ballads, 1810, I, 88.</p>

<p class='c011'>Burton, in the fifth edition of his Anatomy of
Melancholy, Oxford, 1638, p. 536, says: “The very
rusticks and hog-rubbers&nbsp;... have their ballads,
country tunes, O the broome, the bonny, bonny
broome,” etc. (Chappell). This remark is not found
in the fourth edition, Oxford, 1632, p. 544. Concerning
the air, see Chappell’s Popular Music,
pp. 458–61, 613, 783.</p>

<p class='c010'>A young man is deserting one maid for
another. The object of his new fancy lives
at a distance, and he is on his way to her. He
is followed by his old love from stage to stage;
he repelling her, and she tenderly remonstrating.
His heart gradually softens; he buys
her gifts from town to town, and though each
time he bids her go back, he ends with buying
her a wedding gown (ring) and marrying
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two pretty stanzas in <b>A</b>, 4, 5, seem not
to belong to this story. The inconstant
youth would have been only too glad to have
the faithful maid look to other men, and gives
her all liberty to do so. These two stanzas are
first found in Herd’s MSS, I, 53, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Herd’s Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs,
1776, II, 6, as follows:</p>

  <h2 id='c220' class='c009'>220<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>THE BONNY LASS OF ANGLESEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'><b>A.</b> ‘The Bonny Lass of Anglesey,’ Herd’s MSS, I,
148; Herd’s Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs,
1776, II, 231.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> ‘The Bonny Lass o Englessie’s Dance,’ Buchan’s
Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 63.</p>

<p class='c010'>This little ballad might perhaps rightfully
have come in earlier, if I had known what to
make of it. There is a resemblance, remarkable
as far as it goes, to ‘Little Kirstin’s
Dance,’ Grundtvig, V, 118, No 263. Here the
dance is for a match; the lass asks what she
is to have if she wins, and is promised fifteen
(five) ploughs and a mill, and her choice of the
king’s knights for a husband. In the Danish
ballad (<b>A</b>), a king’s son, to induce Little
Kirstin to dance before him, promises a succession
of gifts, none of which avail until he
plights his honor and troth. The remainder
of the story is like the conclusion of ‘Gil
Brenton,’ No 5: see especially I, 66. (Danish
<b>A</b> is translated by Prior, III, 89, No 112.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Kirstin tires out fifteen knights in Danish
<b>A</b> 12, <b>B</b> 10, <b>D</b> 14 (in <b>C</b> 7 eleven); and a
Kirstin tires out fifteen partners again in
Grundtvig, No 126, <b>F</b> 32, No 245, <b>A</b> 16. In
Norwegian versions of No 263, given by
Grundtvig in an appendix, numbers are not
specified; Kirstin in Norwegian <b>A</b> 6, <b>D</b> 18,
tires out all the king’s knights.</p>

<p class='c011'>Buchan quite frightens one by what he says
of his version, II, 314: “It is altogether a
political piece, and I do not wish to interfere
much with it.”</p>

<p class='c022'><b>L.</b> Macmath MS., p. 72, two stanzas.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ballad was first published by Sir Walter
Scott, under the title ‘The Laird of Laminton,’
in the first edition of the Minstrelsy,
1802, I, 216. This copy was fashioned by the
editor from two in Herd’s MSS, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. In
later editions of the Minstrelsy (III, 122,
1833), the ballad was given, with the title
Katharine Janfarie, “in a more perfect state,
from several recited copies.” Twelve stanzas
out of twenty-one, however, are repeated from
the first edition. Much the larger part of
what is not in Herd is taken from <b>C</b>; the
name Lochinvar is adopted from <b>D</b>.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c017'><sup>[116]</sup></a> A few
peculiar readings may be from copies now not
known, or may be the editor’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ballad in Christie, II, 16, is Scott’s
later copy, with the omission of the 16th
stanza. That in Nimmo’s Songs and Ballads
of Clydesdale, p. 141, is <b>J</b>, from Motherwell’s
Minstrelsy.</p>

<p class='c011'>A Scots laird wooes a Scots maid and wins
her favor. An English laird or lord, very
liberal as to gowd and gear, comes to court
the same lass, gains the consent of her friends
(who had at least made no opposition to the
earlier suit), and sets the wedding-day. The
first lover comes to the wedding, backed by a
strong body of armed men, whom he keeps
out of sight. He is asked why he has come;
it is for a sight of the bride or a word with
her, or to take a glass of wine with her or the
bridegroom, and this had he will go away.
Getting near the bride on this pretence, he
swings her on to his horse and is off. A
bloody fight follows, but the bride is not retrieved.
Englishmen may take warning by
this not to seek wives in Scotland; it will
always end in their being tricked and balked.</p>

<p class='c011'>The attitude of the young woman to her
first lover is not distinctly brought out in several
copies. That she had jilted him in favor
of a wealthier Englishman would probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>not lessen the Scot’s pleasure in carrying her
off. In <b>E</b> 18, she does not go willingly; she
greets and wrings her hands, and says it’s
foul play.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c017'><sup>[117]</sup></a> In <b>F</b> 2, <b>G</b> 2, the first lover openly
charges her with changing and foul play, and
such is the implication in <b>E</b> 13. In <b>B</b> 14, the
bride, seeing the bloodshed, exclaims, Wae’s
me for foul play! and her lover replies, Wae
to your wilful will for causing so much good
blood to be spilt! from which we must infer a
fault on her part. <b>I</b> 2 has the ambiguous line
‘and his love drew away,’ which cannot be
interpreted to mean that the first lover was
inconstant without flying in the face of all
the other copies. <b>D</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, unequivocally represent
the lass as faithful to her first love.
The bridegroom, in these versions, arranges
the match with the family, and does not mention
the matter to the lass until the wedding-day:
so in <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c017'><sup>[118]</sup></a> She sends word to her
lover that if he will come for her she will go
with him, <b>D</b>; writes ‘to let him understand,’
<b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, and not to pay him the cold compliment
of an invitation to see her wed the man that
has supplanted him, as in <b>B</b> 3, <b>E</b> 5,<b>F</b> 5, <b>I</b> 3.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>E</b> 7–9, while the first lover is drinking
with his comrades they incite him to carry off
the bride on her wedding-day; so <b>G</b> 6, without
explanation of the circumstances. In
<b>E</b> 7–9, 12–15, he goes to the bridal-house, and
sitting at a table vents words which the other
guests cannot understand: there was a young
man who loved a lass that to-day goes another
man’s bride, and plays her old love foul play;
had <i>he</i> been so served, he would take the bride
away. Upon this the English ask if he wishes
a fight. There is something of this in <b>B</b> 7–10,
<b>F</b> 13, 14, <b>G</b> 11–14.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lover would wish to keep the strong
body of men that he had brought with him
quite in the background until their cue came.
When, therefore, in <b>I</b> 8, 9, the bridegroom’s
friends ask him what was that troop of
younkers they had seen, he puts them off with
the phrase, It must have been the Fairy
Court; so in <b>L</b>. In <b>B</b> 5, 6 (where a stanza,
and more, has dropped out), when the bridegroom
sees this troop from a high window,
the bride (from incredulity, it must be, and
not because she is in concert with her old
lover) says he must have seen the Fairy Court.
<b>G</b> 15, 16, where the phrase comes in again,
seems to have suffered corruption; any way,
the passage is not quite intelligible to me.</p>

<p class='c011'>Katharine Jaffray (Jamphray, Janfarie) is
the lass’s name in <b>A</b>, <b>C-G</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>; Katharine
Johnstone<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c017'><sup>[119]</sup></a> in <b>J</b>; in <b>B</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, she is nameless.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lover is Lochinvar in <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>L</b> (note); Lamington in <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>J</b>; Lauderdale
in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; he has no name in <b>B</b>. The
bridegroom is Lochinvar in <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>; Lamington
in <b>B</b>, Lymington, <b>K</b>; Lauderdale in <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>;
Lochinton <b>A</b>, Lamendall <b>E</b>, Limberdale <b>I</b>
(obvious mixtures of the preceding); Faughanwood
in <b>C</b>; in <b>J</b> he has no name. The
bridegroom should be an Englishman, but
Lochinvar, Lamington, and Lauderdale are all
south-Scottish names. <b>B</b> puts a Scot from the
North Country in place of the titular Englishman
of the other copies, but this Norland
man is laird of Lamington.</p>

<p class='c011'>The place of the fight is Cadan bank and
Cadan brae, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>; Cowden bank (banks)
and Cowden brae (braes), <b>A</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>J</b>, the variation
being perhaps due to the very familiar
Cowdenknows; Callien, Caylin, Caley bank
(buss) and brae, in <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>F</b>; Foudlin dyke and
Foudlin stane in <b>K</b>. No place is named in
<b>B</b>, <b>G</b><a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c017'><sup>[120]</sup></a>. In <b>I</b>, the lass lives in Bordershellin.</p>

<p class='c011'>A copy from the recitation of a young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Irishwoman living in Taunton, Massachusetts
(learned from print, I suppose, and in parts
imperfectly remembered), puts the scene of
the story at Edenborough town. A squire
of high degree had courted a comely country
girl. When her father came to hear of this,
he was an angry man, and “requested of his
daughter dear to suit his company,” or to
match within her degree. The only son of a
farmer in the east had courted this girl until
he thought he had won her, and had got the
consent of her father and mother. The girl
writes the squire a letter to tell him that she
is to be married to the farmer’s son. He
writes in answer that she must dress in green
at her wedding (a color which no Scots girl
would wear, for ill luck), and he will wear a
suit of the same, and wed her ‘in spite of all
that’s there.’ He mounts eight squire-men
on milk-white steeds, and rides ‘to the wedding-house,
with the company dressed in
green.’ (See the note to <b>L</b>.)</p>

from Dundee and takes her to the Highlands.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>She is in a stupor of grief. Glenlion
folds her in his arms, and says that he would
give all his flocks and herds for a kind look.
She tells him that he shall never get look or
smile unless he takes her back to Dundee;
and he her that she shall never see Dundee
till he has married her. His brother John
tries to dissuade him; he himself would scorn
a hand without a heart; but Glenlion has
long loved her, and is resolved to keep her,
nevertheless. Glenlion’s three sisters receive
Baby kindly, and the youngest begs her to
disclose the cause of her grief. Baby tells the
sympathetic Jean that she has been stolen
from her friends and from her lover, and obtains
not only the means of writing a letter
to Johny Hay, the lover, but a swift-footed
boy to carry it to Dundee. Johny Hay,
with a band of armed men, makes all speed to
Glenlion’s castle. He calls to Baby to jump,
and he will catch her; she, more prudently,
slips down on her sheets; her lover takes her
on his horse and rides away. Glenlion hears
the ring of a bridle and thinks it is the priest
come to marry him. His brother corrects
the mistake; there are armed men at the castle-gate,
and it turns out that there are enough
of them to deter Glenlion’s Highlanders from
an attack. So Johny Hay conveys Baby
Livingstone safely back to Dundee.</p>

<p class='c011'>The other versions give the story a tragical
catastrophe. In <b>B</b>, Barbara is forced into
Glenlion’s bed. Afterwards she exclaims
that if she had paper and pen she would write
to her lover in Dundee. No difficulty seems to
be made; she writes her letter, and sends it
by the ever-ready boy. Geordie, lying in a
window, sees the boy, asks for news, and is
told that his love is stolen by Glenlion. He
orders his horse, in fact three horses, and also
a mourning hat and cloak; but though he
tires out all three horses, his love is dead before
he reaches Glenlion. This copy is pieced
out with all sorts of commonplaces from other
ballads: see 9 (which is nonsense), 10, 13, 14,
19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>C</b> is a briefer, that is, an unfarced, form of
<b>B</b>. Glenlion is corrupted to Linlyon.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>D</b> has its commonplaces again. For Barbara
we have Annie, and Glendinning for
Glenlion, and a brother Jemmy instead of a
lover. In <b>E</b> the ravisher is Lochell.</p>

<p class='c011'>The kidnapping of women for a compulsory
marriage was a practice which prevailed for
hundreds of years, and down to a late date,
and, of course, not only in Great Britain.
The unprotected female, especially if she had
any property, must have been in a state of
miserable insecurity, and even a convent was
far from furnishing her an asylum. See for
England, in the first half of the fifteenth century,
Beamont’s Annals of the Lords of Warrington,
pp. 256–61 and 265 f.; for Scotland,
in the same century and the two following,
Sharpe’s Ballad Book, p. 99 ff., R. Chambers’s
Domestic Annals of Scotland, 1858, I,
223–5, 415 f.; for Ireland, Froude, The English
in Ireland in the Eighteenth Century,
1872, I, 417 ff. Other Scottish ballads celebrating
similar abductions are ‘Eppie Morrie,’
‘The Lady of Arngosk,’ and ‘Rob Roy,’
which immediately follow.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c017'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 id='c223' class='c009'>223<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>EPPIE MORRIE</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>‘Eppie Morrie,’ Maidment’s North Countrie Garland, p. 40, 18</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“This ballad,” says Maidment, “is probably
much more than a century old, though
the circumstances which have given rise to it
were unfortunately too common to preclude
the possibility of its being of a later date.”
He does not tell us where the ballad came
from, and no other editor seems to know of it.
Two stanzas, 10, 11, occur in a copy of ‘Rob
Roy’ (No 225, <b>J</b>) which had once been in
Maidment’s hands, and perhaps was obtained
from the same region.</p>

<p class='c011'>Four-and-twenty Highlanders, the leader of
whom is one Willie, come to Strathdon from
Carrie (Carvie?) side to steal away Eppie
Morrie, who has refused to marry Willie.
They tie her on a horse and take her to a
minister, whom Willie, putting a pistol to his
breast, orders to marry them. The minister
will not consent unless Eppie is willing, and
she strenuously refuses; so they take her to
Carrie side and put her to bed. She defends
herself successfully, and in the morning comes
in her lover, Belbordlane, or John Forsyth,
well armed, and we presume well supported,
who carries her back to her mother, to be his
bride.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scott, Introduction to Rob Roy, Appendix,
No V, cites two stanzas of a ballad derived
from tradition which, if we had the whole,
might possibly turn out to be the same story
with different names.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>Sharpe’s Ballad Book, 1823, p. 99.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“The following fragment,” says Sharpe in
his preface (he had not then recovered the
second stanza), “I cannot illustrate either
from history or tradition.” Very soon after
the publication of the Ballad Book, full particulars
of the carrying off of the Lady of
Arngosk were procured for him by David
Webster, the bookseller. Webster addressed
himself to Mrs Isobell Dow, otherwise Mrs
Mac Leish, of Newburgh, Fife, whose mother,
he had learned, was waiting-maid to the lady
at the time of the rape. “In my very early
years,” he wrote, July 4, 1823, “I have listened
with great delight to my mother when
she sung me a song the first stanza of which
was this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Highlandmen are a’ cum down,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They’re a’ cum down almost,</div>
      <div class='line'>They’ve stowen awa the bonny lass,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The lady of Arngosk.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Now Miss Finlay informs me that Isobel
Stewart, your mother, was waiting-maid to
the ‘bonny lass’ at the time she was ‘stowen
awa,’ and that you are the most likely person
now alive who will be able to recollect the
song, or the particulars that gave rise to it.
My reason for requesting this favour from a
lady I have not the pleasure to know is, some
gentlemen, my acquaintance, are making a
collection of old Scots songs, which is printing,
and they are anxious to have it as full as
possible. We therefore wish a copy of the
song entire, if you can recollect it, and the
name of the lady who was the ‘bonny lass,’”
etc. Mrs Dow replied, July 8, through John
Masterton, that she was “sorrow” to say that
she could not recollect more of the song than
Webster was already in possession of, but the
story she could never forget, having heard her
mother repeat it so often: and this story
Masterton proceeds to give in Mrs Dow’s own
words. Although Mrs Dow was liberal of details,
Webster seems to have wanted to hear
more, and accordingly Masterton writes at
greater length July 30, repeating what had
been said before, with “some particular incidents”
omitted in the former letter, but nothing
very material except that Miss Gibb was
rich, and that Isobell Dow had “brought to
her recolection another verse of the song”
(st. 2). The earlier letter even is somewhat
out of proportion to so meagre a relic of verse,
an intolerable deal of bread to a half-penny
worth of sack; but it is very readable, and
has some value as a chapter from domestic
life in Scotland in the first half of the last
century.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c017'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>My mother was waiting-maid to the Lady of
Arngask, whose name was Miss Margret Gibb, at
which time two gentlemen paid addresses to her;
the one a Mr Jamieson, a writer in Strathmiglo,
the other a Mr Graham, of Bracko Castle, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the subject of the story; but his love did not meet
with a return suitable to his wishes; he therefore
came to the strong resolution of taking her away
by force. It will be proper to mention that he came
two nights previous, when my mother was in the
barn dighting corn, and accosted her thus: Tiby,
I want to see Margret. She answerd: I doubt,
Mr Graham, you canna see her the night, but I’ll
gang an tell her. She went and was orderd to
tell him that he could not see her; which put him
in such a frenzy that he ran up and down the barn
through chaff and corn up to the middle; however,
he forced in to her company, but what passed betwixt
them my mother did not know. But on the
second night after, at midnight, when in bed (my
mother alway sleeping with Miss Gibb),<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c017'><sup>[125]</sup></a> a very
sharp knock was heard at the door, which alarmd
them very much, it being a lonely place. My
mother went and called, who was there; she was
answered, Open the door, Tiby, and see. She
said: Keep me! Mr Graham, what way are you
here at this time? Ye canna won in the night.
She drew the bar, and was almost frighted out of
her sences by the appearance of above thirty Hillandmen
on horseback, all armed with swords and
dirks, &amp;c. She atempted to shut the door again,
but Mr Graham pressed his knee in and forced his
way. He went ben, and ordered them to put on
their clothes an go along with him. Miss Gibb
insisted on stoping ere daylight, and she would go
with good will; but he would admit of no delay, but
ordered her to dress herself imediately, otherwise he
would do it by force. She then said she would not
go unless Tiby acompanied her, which he said he
intended to propose had she not mentioned it; but
my mother would not go, she said, to ride behind
none of these Hillandmen. Mr Graham then proposed
to take her behind himself. They did then
all mount; he at the same time used the precaution
of placing sentries on the houses where the other
servants lodged, to prevent them giving the alarm,
and also three stout men at the bell of the church,
to prevent it being rung. They kept their posts
till they thought them a sufficient distance on the
way, Mr Graham always joking to my mother about
something or other, asuring her so soon as he had
all over he would make her happy and comfortable
all the days of her life. They rode on over hill and
dale till within sight of Bracko Castle, when all of
a sudden the Hillanmen  dispersed, or deserted them,
excepting his own imediate servants; which my
mother thought was because he had deceived them,
saying that the lady was willing to marry him but
her friends would not alow, which by this time they
must have found out. He told my mother that a
minister was waiting them at Bracko, but he must
have been disappointed, for the minister never appeared;
else, she always thought, they would been
married. Report said that Mr Jamieson had so
contrived to stop his arrival. My mother and Miss
Margret were then secured in an uper room in the
castle till the next day, when there appeared mostly
all the men of the parishes of Arngask and Strathmiglo,
demanding their lady; my father among the
rest, demanding my mother as his intended wife.
It seemed so soon as the Hillan sentries were gone
from the houses and church-bell of Arngask, that
the servants ran to the bell, and rang such a peal as
made all the Ochles resound wi the sad news that
their lady was stowen awa by Graham an his clan.
Mr Jamieson was no less busy in alarming and rousing
the indignation of the good folk of Strathmiglo,
who were much atached to her interest, so that
both parishes rose to a man, and armed themselves
with whatever came in the way, and marched in a
body to make an attack on the castle, and rescue
their much esteemed lady. But on their making
their appearance before the castle in such formidable
array, Mr Graham thought it prudent to surender
rather than sustain the attack of such a body of desperate
men. Mr Graham conducted them down
stairs with his cap in hand (the gentlemen in those
days wore velvet caps), and addressed her thus:
I shall see you on your horse, Margret, for a’ the
ill you’ve done me, and bade her a long and lasting
farewell; at which she stamped with her foot
and recommended him to the devil. They all came
home in safety, and the bells, that so lately rang to
alarm and spread the dismal news, were again rung
to proclaim the happy return of the lady that was
stowen awa. Bonefires were also erected on the
highest of the Ochles. She was married that same
year to Mr Jamieson, and I suppose some of their
children are alive to this day. It was generaly
reported that Mr Graham was so much affronted
at the dissapointment that he left the country soon
after.</p>

lived together fifty-one years, it being now thirty-four

<p class='c010'>The hero of this ballad was the youngest
of the five sons of the Rob Roy who has been
immortalized by Sir Walter Scott, and was
known as Robert Oig, young, or junior. When
a mere boy (only twelve years old, it is said)
he shot a man mortally whom he considered
to have intruded on his mother’s land, and
for not appearing to underlie the law for this
murder he was outlawed in 1736. He had
fled to the continent, and there he enlisted in
the British army, and was wounded and made
prisoner at Fontenoy in 1745. He was exchanged,
returned to Scotland and obtained a
discharge from service, and, though still under
ban, was able to effect a marriage with a
woman of respectable family. She lived but
a few years, and after her death, whether
spontaneously or under the influence of his
brother James, a man of extraordinary hardihood,
Rob Oig formed a plan of bettering his
own fortune, and incidentally that of his kin,
by a marriage of the Sabine fashion with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>woman of means. The person selected was
Jean Key, who had been two months the
widow of John Wright. She was but nineteen
years of age, and was living with her
mother at Edinbelly, in Stirlingshire, and her
property is said to have been, not the twenty
thousand pounds of some of the ballads, but
some sixteen or eighteen thousand marks.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the night of December 8, 1750, Rob
Oig, accompanied by his brothers James and
Duncan and others, first placing guards at the
door and windows, to prevent escape from
within and help from without, entered the
house of Jean Key, and not finding her, because
she had taken alarm and hidden herself
in a closet, obliged the mother to produce
her daughter, under threats “to murder every
person in the family, or to burn the house
and every person in it alive.” Jean Key, on
being brought out, was told by James MacGregor
that the party had come to marry her
to Robert, his brother.” Upon her desiring
to be allowed till next morning, or some few
hours, to deliberate upon the answer she was
to give to so unexpected and sudden a proposal
as a marriage betwixt her, then not two
months a widow, and a man with whom she
had no manner of acquaintance,” after some
little expostulation, they laid hands upon her,
dragged her out of doors, tied her on the back
of a horse, and carried her first to a house at
Buchanan, six miles from Edinbelly, thence
to Rowerdennan, “thence, by water, to some
part of the Highlands about the upper part of
Loch Lomond, out of the reach of her friends
and relations, where she was detained in captivity
and carried from place to place for upwards
of three months.” At Rowerdennan,
or further north, a priest read the marriage-service
while the resolute James held up the
young woman before him, and declared Rob
Oig and her to be man and wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rest of the story does not come into
the ballad, but it may be added that both the
military and the civil power took the matter
in hand; that the MacGregors found it necessary
to release their captive (who died, but
not of the violence she had undergone, ten
months after she was taken away); that
James MacGregor was brought to trial in July,
1752, for hamesucken (invasion of a private
house), forcible abduction of a woman, and
constraining her to a marriage, was convicted
of a part of the charge but not of the last
count, and while the court had the verdict under
consideration made his escape from Edinburgh
castle; that Rob Oig was apprehended
the following year, tried and condemned to
death, and was executed in February, 1754.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c017'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>We may easily believe that, as Scott says,
the imagination of half-civilized Highlanders
was not much shocked at the idea of winning
a wife in a violent way. It had been common,
and they may naturally have wondered
why it should seem so particular in their instance.
It is certain that Jean Key did not
receive the sympathy of all of her own sex.
A lady of much celebrity has told us that it
is safest in matrimony to begin with a little
aversion, and there were those in Jean Key’s
day, and after, who thought it mere silliness to
make a coil about a little compulsion. “It is
not a great many years,” Sir Walter Scott testifies,
“since a respectable woman, above the
lower rank of life, expressed herself very
warmly to the author on his taking the freedom
to censure the behaviour of the MacGregors
on the occasion in question. She said, ‘that
there was no use in giving a bride too much
choice upon such occasions; that the marriages
were happiest lang syne which had
been done off hand.’ Finally, she averred
that her ‘own mother had never seen her
father till the night he brought her up from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>the Lennox with ten head of black cattle, and
there had not been a happier couple in the
country.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>The ballad adheres to fact rather closely;
indeed a reasonably good “dittay” could be
made out of it. The halt at Buchanan is
mentioned <b>B</b> 8, <b>C</b> 10, <b>K</b> 14; the road would
be through Drymen, as in <b>C</b> 10, <b>K</b> 13; and Balmaha,
<b>H</b> 2, is a little beyond Buchanan. Ballyshine
is substituted for Buchanan in <b>E</b> 6, <b>J</b>
4. At Buchanan, or Ballyshine (‘as they
came in by Drimmen town, and in by Edingarry,’
<b>K</b> 13), a cloak and gown are bought
(fetched) for the young woman to be married
in, <b>B</b> 8, <b>C</b> 10, <b>F</b> 4. It is a cotton gown, <b>E</b> 6,
coat and gown, <b>A</b> 8; in cotton gown she is
married, <b>J</b> 4; meaning probably that she was
married in a night-gown, having been roused
from her bed. It is at Buchanan, or Ballyshine,
that she is married. Four held her up
to the priest, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b> (two, <b>D</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, three, <b>E</b>,
<b>J</b>, six, <b>B</b>), four laid her in bed, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>J</b>, <b>K</b> (two, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>).</p>

<p class='c011'>Rob Roy is said to come from Drunkie
(the home of his first wife), <b>J</b> 1; to come over
the Loch of Lynn, <b>G</b> 2. Jean Key’s abode
seems to be called White House (Wright?)
in <b>A</b> 2, but Blackhills, <b>C</b> 2, and in <b>K</b> 2 Jean
Key is called Blackhill’s daughter. Blackhill
is apparently a corruption of Mitchell, Jean’s
mother’s maiden name. The mother is called
Jean Mitchell in <b>J</b> 2.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>A</b> 8, Rob Roy’s party are wrongly said
to tarry at Stirling. In <b>J</b> 2, Glengyle is said
to go with him to steal Jean Mitchell’s daughter.
Glengyle, Rob Oig’s cousin, and chief
of his immediate family was, for a MacGregor,
an orderly man,<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c017'><sup>[127]</sup></a> and did not countenance
the proceeding. <b>J</b> 6, 7 belong to the ballad
of ‘Eppie Morrie,’ No 223.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rob Oig puts Jean Key’s fortune at £20,000,
<b>A</b> 13, <b>C</b> 19; 50,000 merks, <b>D</b> 14; 30,000,
<b>K</b> 23; 20,000, which was not very far from
right, <b>E</b> 10. The reading in <b>B</b> 15 is a manifest
corruption of thirty thousand merks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Rob Roy is in several copies spoken of
as still alive. Though the time both of his
birth and death is not accurately known, this
was certainly not the case.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of <b>A</b> a Professor Robert Scott says, in the
letter in which it was enclosed: “You will
find above, all I have been able to procure in
order to replace the lost fragment of ‘Lizie
Lindsay.’ I believe it is not so correct or so
complete as what was formerly sent, but there
are materials enough to operate upon, and by
forcing the memory of the recorder more harm
than good might have been done.” Jamieson
says of <b>b</b>: “Transmitted to the editor by Professor
Scott of Aberdeen, as it was taken down
from the recitation of an old woman.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c017'><sup>[128]</sup></a> It is
very popular in the northeast[north-east] of Scotland, and
was familiar to the editor in his early youth;
and from the imperfect recollection which he
still retains of it he has corrected the text in
two or three unimportant passages.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is nothing to show whether the lost
copy was recovered, unless it be the fact that
Jamieson prints about twice as many stanzas
as there are in <b>a</b>. But Jamieson was not always
precise in the account he gave of the
changes he made in his texts.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his preface to <b>B</b>, Kinloch remarks that
the ballad is very popular in the North, “and
few milk-maids in that quarter but can chaunt
it, to a very pleasant tune. Lizie Lindsay,”
he adds, “according to the tradition of
Mearnsshire, is said to have been a daughter
of Lindsay of Edzell; but I have searched in
vain for genealogical confirmation of the tradition.”
Kinloch gave Aytoun a copy of this
version, changing a few phrases, and inserting
st. 20 of <b>C</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following stanza, printed as No 434 of
the Musical Museum, was sent with the air to
Johnson by Burns, who intended to communicate
something more. (Museum, 1853, IV,
382):</p>

      <div class='line in2'>My pride and my darling to be?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Robert Allan added three stanzas to this,
Smith’s Scotish Minstrel, II, 100, and again,
p. 101 of the same, others (in which Lizie
Lindsay is, without authority, made ‘a puir
lassie’). The second stanza of the second
“set” is traditional (cf. <b>B</b> 8, <b>C</b> 6, <b>D</b> 6, <b>E</b> 8):</p>

<p class='c011'>Donald MacDonald, heir of Kingcausie,
wishes to go to Edinburgh for a wife (or to
get Lizie Lindsay for his wife). His mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>consents, on condition that he shall use no
flattery, and shall ‘court her in great poverty’
(policy, <b>D</b>). He sees many bonny
young ladies at Edinburgh, but Lizie Lindsay
is above compare with others. He presents
himself to her in simple Highland garb;
what he can offer is a diet of curds and whey
and a bed of green rushes (bracken). Lizie
would like to know where she would be going,
and with whom. His father is an old shepherd
(couper, souter), his mother an old dey,
and his name is Donald MacDonald. Lizie’s
father and mother threaten to have him
hanged, which daunts him not in the least.
Her maid warmly seconds the suit. Lizie
packs up her clothes and sets forth with Donald
to foot the steep and dirty ways; she
wishes herself back in Edinburgh. They
come at last to a shieling, where a woman
welcomes Sir Donald; he bids her call him
Donald her son, and orders a supper of curds
and whey, and a bed of green rushes. Lizie,
‘weary with travel,’ lies late in the
morning, and is roused as if to help at the
milking; this makes her repine again. But
Donald takes her out of the hut and shows
her Kingcausie, where she is to be lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kingcausie is some seven miles from Aberdeen,
on the south side of the Dee.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ballads of this description are peculiarly
liable to interpolation and debasement, and
there are two passages, each occurring in several
versions, which we may, without straining,
set down to some plebeian improver.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>B</b> 10, <b>D</b> 10, <b>E</b> 19, Lizie Lindsay, not
quite ready to go with Donald, makes him an
offer of five or ten guineas if he will stay long
enough for her to take his picture, ‘to keep
her from thinking long.’ In <b>F</b> 11 Donald
makes the same offer for her picture. In <b>E</b> 10,
<b>F</b> 6, Lizie tells Donald, who has asked where
she lives, that if he will call at the Canongate
Port, she will drink a bottle of sherry
with him, and in the next stanza she is as
good as her word. This convivial way of the
young ladies of Edinburgh is, owing to an
injury to the text, not perceptible in <b>D</b> 14,
where Donald seems to be inviting Lizie’s
mother to bring a bottle of sherry with her in
case she should call on him at the Canongate
Port.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>a.</b> ‘Bonny Lizie Balie, A New Song very much in Request,’
Laing broadsides, No 46; no date or place.
<b>b.</b> ‘Bonny Lizzie Bailie,’ Maidment’s Scotish Ballads
and Songs, 1859, p. 13. <b>c.</b> ‘My bonny Lizzie
Baillie,’ Johnson’s Museum, ed. 1853, IV, *451.
<b>d.</b> ‘Lizae Baillie,’ Herd’s MSS, I, 101, and, in

North of Scotland, II, 173.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>a</b>, from the collection of broadsides made
by David Laing, now in the possession of
Lord Rosebery, may probably have been
printed at the beginning of the last century,
at Edinburgh. <b>b</b> was taken “from a tolerably
old copy printed at Glasgow.” Excepting
the lack of two stanzas, the variations from a
are mostly of slight consequence; two or
three are for the better, <b>c</b> (only the beginning,
stanzas 1–4<sup>1</sup>) was communicated by
C. K. Sharpe, from a “MS. copy of some antiquity.”
<b>d-g</b> are of no authority. <b>d</b>, <b>e</b> are
fragmentary stanzas, misremembered if not
corrupted. <b>f</b> has ten stanzas, eight of which
(some with a word or two changed) are from
<b>d.</b> <b>g</b> is a washy <i>rifacimento</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>d</b> is printed in Herd’s Ancient and Modern
Scottish Songs, 1776, II, 3. The copy in
Johnson’s Museum, No 456, p. 469, is <b>d</b> without
the first stanza.</p>

<p class='c011'>Stanzas 19–21 of <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and their representatives
in <b>d</b>, <b>e</b>, recall ‘The Gypsy Laddie.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Lizzie Baillie, of Castle Gary, Stirlingshire,
while paying a visit to a sister at Gartartan,
Perthshire, makes an excursion to Inchmahome,
an island in Loch Menteith. Here she
meets Duncan Graham, who, against the opposition
of her parents, persuades her to prefer
a Highland husband to any Lowland or
English match.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The heroine of this song,” says Sharpe,
“was a daughter of Baillie of Castle Carey,
and sister, as it is said, to the wife of Macfarlane
of Gartartan.” The Baillies, as Maidment
has shown, acquired Castle Gary “at a
comparatively recent date,” and that editor
must be nearly, or quite, right in declaring the
ballad to be not older than the commencement
of the last century. Buchan has a bit of
pseudo-history anent Lizie Baillie in his notes,
at II, 326.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story is told in a somewhat disorderly
way even in a, and we may believe that we
have not attained the original yet, though this
copy is much older than any that has appeared
in previous collections.</p>

<p class='c011'>A young Highlander comes to Glasgow and
is smitten with bonnie Peggie. Her father
says the Highlander may steal cow or ewe, but
not Peggie; and her mother asks in disgust
whether her daughter, so long the object of
her care, would end with going off in such
company. For all that, Peggie goes. The
Earl of Argyle, or the Earl of Hume, or the
young Earl of Hume, takes this much to
heart. The pair ride to a low glen in the
north country, and lie down on the grass.
The Lowland lass has some compunctions,
stimulated by the lack of the good beds at
home. The captivating Highlander reassures
her. He has the same comforts which she
misses; they are his, and will soon be hers.
He points out a fine castle which is his too,
and he himself is Donald, Earl of Skye, and
she will be a lady. <b>B</b> and <b>E</b>, to make the
contrast of her two homes the greater, maintain
that, despite her regrets for the comforts
of her father’s mansion, all that Peggie left
was a wee cot-house and a wee kail-yairdie.</p>

  <h2 id='c229' class='c009'>229<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>EARL CRAWFORD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'><b>A. a.</b> ‘Earl Crawford,’ Christie’s Traditional Ballad
Airs, I, 290, from recitation.  <b>b.</b> From recitation.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> ‘Earl Crawford,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the North of
Scotland, I, 61. Abridged, in Christie’s Traditional
Ballad Airs, I, 68.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>A.</b> One of seven handsome sisters makes a
great match with the Earl of Crawford. In a
fit of jealousy at the fondness which he shows
his young son, Ladie Lillie addresses to her
husband a quip on that head, to which the
earl replies in the same tone. But the matter
does not end there. The earl sets his wife on
a horse, with her son, and sends her home to
her father at Stobhall, never to enter his gates
again. Her father is surprised that she should
come without notice or attendants; she tells
him that a word from her merry mouth has
parted her and her lord. The father offers to
make a better match for her; she would not
give a kiss of Crawford’s for all her father’s
gold. She sends a messenger to the earl to
see whether he retains affection for her; word
is brought back that she is to stay with her
father and never enter Crawford’s gates again.
Her heart breaks. Her father puts on black,
rides to Crawford’s, and finds the earl just
setting forth with a party to bring Lady Lillie
home. Upon learning that his wife is
dead, the earl declares that the sun shall nevermore
shine on him.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>B.</b>  Lady Crawford rides to her husband’s
castle in person to see if the earl will pity her.
He shuts his gates and steeks his doors, and
will neither come down to speak with her himself
nor send his man. She retires weeping.
The earl in turn now goes to the castle where
his lady is lying, to see if she will pity him.
She shuts the gates and steeks the doors,
and will neither come down to speak with him
nor send her waiting-maid. Not the less she
takes to her bed, both she and Crawford die
before morning, and both are buried in one
tomb.</p>

<p class='c011'>The late Earl of Crawford recognized an
agreement with fact in some of the details of
this story: Christie, I, 289. David, eleventh
earl of Crawford, who succeeded his father in
1574, married Lilias Drummond, daughter of
David, second Lord Drummond, the Laird of
Stobhall. This was considered so great a
match for the lady that a tocher was given
with her “far beyond what was customary in
those times, to wit, ten thousand merks.” Although
the peerages mention no children by
this marriage, there is evidence that Earl David
had by Lilias “an only child, David, who
died in infancy.” “These collateral verities”
seemed to Earl Crawford “to found a
presumption in favor of the truth of the main
incident of the ballad.” Crawford did not
live at Crawford Castle, as the ballad has it.
“That place had ceased to be the family residence
for a long while. Earl David lived at
Finhaven Castle, in Angus; not too far from
Stobhall to be in keeping with the riding to
and fro recorded in the ballad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The first lines of the ballad are probably
borrowed from ‘Gil Brenton:’ see No 5, <b>A</b>
43, <b>B</b> 34, <b>C</b> 1, <b>D</b> 1, <b>H</b> 1, 2. <b>A</b> 11, 12, <b>B</b> 15, 16,
is a commonplace: see most of the versions of
‘Jamie Douglas,’ No 204, and of ‘The Braes
o Yarrow,’ No 214, and ‘Clerk Saunders,’ No
69, <b>E</b> 15, <b>G</b> 27.</p>

  <h2 id='c230' class='c009'>230<br /> <br /> THE SLAUGHTER OF THE LAIRD OF MELLERSTAIN</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>In a folio volume with the title “Miscellanies,” the last piece in the volume, Abbotsford.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Birrel’s Diary has this entry under date
of January 3, 1603: “The 3 of Januar Johne
Hai[t]lie of Millstanes slaine at the Salt Tron
be Williame Home hes guidfather. This William
of Ball[int]a wes of the hous of Cowdenknowis.”
P. 57. In a proclamation of the
Privy Council against reset of criminals, 20th
January, 1603, the list of cases begins with
“the reset of the persons who lately most
shamefully and barbarously slew the Laird of
Mellestanes.” Register, VI, 525 f. There is
nothing to show that these persons were ever
brought to justice, and the efforts made by
the public authorities to stop hostilities between
the families concerned were, as usual,
not readily successful. April 28, 1608, the
parties to the “feud between James Haitlie,
now of Mellirstanes [son of John], and Mr
James Home of Eccles, on account of the
slaughter of John Haitlie of Mellirstanes,”
are ordered to appear before the Council on
the 12th of May following, to be reconciled
and to chop hands together. Register, VIII,
81 f.</p>

<p class='c011'>An entry of the 4th of December, 1599,
censures Sir George Home, sheriff of Berwick,
for not proceeding against “William Home,
younger, called of Coldenknowis and now of
Ballinta, who slew within the said shire Mr
Alexander Dicksoun,” and was denounced
therefor 29th December, 1596. This William
we may presume to have been the undegenerate
son of the William whom Birrel calls
Mellerstain’s “guidfather.” Register, VI, 57.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady of st. 1 was Marion Lumsden
(otherwise Mariot, Margaret), “Lady Mellirstanes,”
“relicta Joannis Haitlie de Mellerstanes.”
Register P. C., VIII, 101; 366, Register
of the Great Seal, VI, 722. Mellerstain
stands on a rising ground near the right bank
of the Eden, 1<sup>2</sup>. Cowdenknows in 3<sup>1</sup> may
have been Sir John Home of Cowdenknows,
named as one of the curators of James Haitlie
(a minor in 1607). Earlstoun is not determinate.
Bemerside is an alternative reading
for Earlstoun. The laird of Bemerside at the
date of the slaughter was the turbulent James
Haig. The lady in st. 4 is looking in several
directions for the arrival of her husband’s
body. (I have not found Fieldiesha and
Yirdandstane.) The Salt Tron is a locality
of much note in the history of Edinburgh:
see Wilson’s Memorials, p. 249.</p>

<p class='c011'>This fragment appears to have come into
Sir Walter Scott’s hands through Mr W. Yellowlees,
who filled out two of the defective
stanzas, and appended some remarks under
the date of 29th October, 1828.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c017'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Sir Gilbert Hay, tenth Earl of Errol,
was married to Lady Catherine Carnegy,
younger daughter of James, second Earl of
Southesk, January 7, 1658, and had no children
by her. He died in 1674. The ballad,
says the person who communicated <b>A b</b> to the
Edinburgh Miscellany, was “founded, it would
seem, on some attempt to withhold from the
Earl of Errol his consort’s portion.” It will
be observed that the father proposes a beguiling
to his daughter, and that she is ready to
assent, in <b>A</b>, 12, 13.</p>

<p class='c011'>It appears from a letter cited by Sharpe
in his Ballad Book that the matters treated
in the ballad were agitating, and had even
“come to public hearing,” in February, 1659.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir John Hay of Killour, as the nearest
male heir, became the eleventh Earl of Errol.
His wife was Lady Anne Drummond, only
daughter of James, third Earl of Perth, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>that the Earl of Perth might seem to have
an interest in this affair of Errol’s. She, however,
was not born till January, 1656. Perth
is actually made the other party in legal proceedings
in <b>A a</b> 1, but in <b>A b</b> seems to espouse
Errol’s side.</p>

<p class='c011'>Carnegy’s other daughter, who in most of
the versions censures her sister’s conduct,
is called Jean in <b>A</b> 5, <b>D a</b> 7, <b>F</b> 10, Anne
in <b>D b c</b>. These are stock ballad-names, and
we need not suppose that Anne comes from
Lady Anne Drummond. The older daughter’s
name was Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Errol is in the Carse of Gowrie, a tract
noted for its fertility; which accounts for <b>B</b> 2,
<b>D a</b> 1, <b>D c</b> 1, <b>F</b> 2.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>E</b>, <b>F</b> go the length of imputing to Lady
Errol an attempt to poison her husband with
wine which she offers him. A page, of Errol’s
kin, exposes her in <b>E</b>; in <b>F</b> Errol
gives the drink to a greyhound, and the dog
bursts.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last stanza of <b>A b</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D c</b> has reference
to “the ancient separate maintenance of
a lady dissatisfied with or apart from her husband.”
(Edinburgh Magazine, as above.)</p>

<p class='c011'><b>E</b> is introduced in Sharpe’s letter by some
pages of mild pleasantry in the form of a
preface to “a specimen of the fourth volume
of the Border Minstrelsy, speedily to be published.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>The youngest (eldest, <b>A</b>) and fairest of the
daughters of the Earl of Wigton, <b>A</b>, <b>F</b> (bonniest
of his sisters, <b>E</b>), has fallen in love with
her footman, Richie Story (Tory). Richie
brings her a letter from a nobleman who desires
to be her suitor; the Earl of Hume, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G a</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>e</b>; the Earl of Hume’s son, <b>D</b>;
the Earl of Aboyne, <b>E</b>; of Cumbernauld, <b>G b</b>;
of Mohun, <b>G c</b>; of Wemyss, <b>G f</b> and a variant
of <b>E</b>; the Earls of Hume and Skimmerjim,
Skimmerham (Kimmerghame), <b>C</b>. The lady
has made a vow, and will keep it, to marry
none but Richie. Richie deprecates; he has
nothing to maintain her with; she is ready to
descend to the lowest fortune. (In several
versions she has enough of her own. Hunten
Tour and Tillebarn and the House of Athol
are hers, <b>B</b>; Musselburgh, <b>C</b>; the House of
Athol and Taranadie, <b>G d</b>; Blair-in-Athol
and Dunkeld, <b>H</b>.) Asked by her sister, by
Richie, or by some one else, whether she is
not sorry to have left Cumbernauld (Castle
Norry, <b>G f</b>) to follow a footman, she answers
that there is no reason, she has her heart’s
desire and the lot that was ordained her. As
she goes up the Parliament close, rides
through Edinburgh town, Glasgow city (London
city, <b>C b</b>, absurdly), she is greeted by
many a lord, but few or none of them thought
she was a footman’s lady. Arrived at the
domicile of the Storys, her good-mother bids
her, gars her, kilt up her coats and muck the
byres with Richie.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, are not satisfied with this conclusion.
The footman is really a lover in disguise, the
Earl of Hume or of Cumbernauld, <b>F</b>, <b>G a b</b>.
(<b>G b 2</b> spoils the plot by making the Earl
of Hume write to the lady that he will be her
footman-laddie.) Four-and-twenty gentlemen
welcome the bride at Ritchie’s gates, or elsewhere,
and she blesses the day that she was
Richie’s lady. This is incontestably a later
invention.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>G f</b>, which is otherwise embellished, goes a
good step beyond <b>G a-e</b>. Richie is an Englishman
and takes the lady to London. ‘Madam’
has left her kindred to gang with a servant;
he has ‘left the sceptre and the crown’ her
servant for to be; little she knew that her
waiting-man was England’s royal king.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lillias Fleming, second daughter of John,
Earl of Wigton by his wife Jane Drummond
(a daughter of the Earl of Perth), did elope
with and marry one of her father’s servants,
named Richard Storry. In 1673, she, with
consent of her husband, resigned her portion,
consisting of the five-merk land of Smythson,
etc., in the barony of Lenzie, into the hands
of her brother, Lieutenant-Colonel Fleming.
The Fleming family afterwards procured for
Richie a situation in the Custom-House.” So
Hunter, Biggar and the House of Fleming,
p. 555, and, in part, Douglas’s Peerage, where,
however, Lady Lillias is said to have married
Richard Storry, “Esq.:” ed. Wood, II, 616.</p>

<p class='c011'>Douglas notes that “John, third Earl of
Wigton,&nbsp;... had a charter of the lordship of
Cumbernauld, 1st February, 1634.” This
place (Comarnad, Campernadie, etc., <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>G a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>) is in Dumbartonshire. In <b>F 11</b> it
is attributed to the young Earl of Hume, and
the disguised lover is the Earl of Cumbernauld
in <b>G b</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady, ready for any extremity, says in
<b>F 6</b> that she will lie ayont a dyke (on the
other side of a wall), in <b>E 6</b> sit below the
dyke, in <b>D 5</b> sit aneath the duke, and that she
will be at Richie’s command at all times. This
matter was not understood by the reciter of
<b>B</b>, and in <b>B 7</b> the lady is made to say, We will
go to sea, I’ll sit upon the <i>deck</i> (and be your
servant, as in the other cases). In <b>A</b> the difficulty,
such as it is, seems to have been evaded,
and we read, <b>6</b>, I’ll live whereer you please
(and be ready at your call late or early).</p>

<h3 class='c023'>APPENDIX</h3>

<p class='c038'>Aytoun, II, 239, says of ‘Richie Storie,’ The
words, recast in a romantic form and applied to a
more interesting subject, have been set to music by
a noble lady, and are now very popular under the
title of ‘Huntingtower.’ The history of ‘Huntingtower’
is not so well known as might be expected.
I have not been able to ascertain the authorship or
the date of its first appearance (which was very
probably in society rather than in print). ‘Richie
Storie’ is not carried by our texts further back than
1802–3 (<b>B</b>, <b>H</b>). Kinloch published in 1827 a ballad
from recitation, ‘The Duke of Athol,’ which is
‘Huntingtower’ passed through the popular mouth;
for ‘Huntingtower’ became, and has continued to
be, a favorite with the people. Christie, Traditional
Ballad Airs, I, 166, says that he had often heard
‘The Duke of Athol’ in his early years, and he
gives eight stanzas which do not differ remarkably
from Kinloch’s ballad.</p>

<p class='c011'>The marks of the derivation of ‘Huntingtower’
are the terminations of lines 1, 2, 4 of each stanza,
and substantial agreements in the last two stanzas
with <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, 5, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, 4, and with <b>B</b> 6, <b>C</b> 7,
<b>H</b>, respectively. The name Huntingtower occurs
only in <b>B</b> 6 of ‘Richie Storie.’ The author of
‘Huntingtower’ was no doubt possessed of a version
of ‘Richie Storie’ which had its own peculiarities.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Huntingtower’ is too well known to require citing.
It has been often printed; as, for example,
in Mr G. F. Graham’s Popular Songs of Scotland,
revised by J. Muir Wood, Balmoral Edition, Glasgow,
1887, p. 152; The Songs of Scotland, the
words revised by Dr Charles Mackay, p. 5, London,
Boosey &amp; Co. (Altered by the Baroness Nairne,
and very little left of it, Life and Songs of the Baroness
Nairne, edited by the Rev. Charles Rogers,
1872, p. 177.) The pleasing air strongly resembles,
says Mr Wood, one in D’Urfey’s Pills to
Purge Melancholy, V, 42, ed. 1719.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The Duke of Athol’ may be given for the interest
it has as a popular <i>rifacimento</i>.</p>

  <h2 id='c233' class='c009'>233<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>ANDREW LAMMIE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'><b>A.</b> ‘The Trumpeter of Fyvie,’ Jamieson’s Popular
Ballads, I, 126, 1806.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B</b>. ‘Tifty’s Nanny,’ Jamieson’s Popular Ballads, II,
382, from a stall-copy.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>C. a.</b> ‘Andrew Lammie,’ Buchan’s Gleanings, p. 98,
1825 ; Laing’s Thistle of Scotland, p. 55, 1823.
<b>b.</b> Motherwell’s Minstrelsy, p. 239.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jamieson, in his preface, 1806, says that
this ballad was current in the Border counties
within a few years, and that <b>A</b> was taken
down by Leyden from the recitation of a young
lady who learned it in Teviotdale. Writing
to Scott, in November, 1804, of such ballads
as he had already prepared for the press,
he says, “Trumpeter of Fyvie, from tradition,
furnished by Mr Leyden, and collated with a
stall-copy” (probably <b>B</b>): Letters addressed
to Sir Walter Scott, Abbotsford, I, No. 117.</p>

<p class='c011'>Buchan, in the notes to his Gleanings, 1825,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>p. 197, says of <b>C a</b>: “This is one of the greatest
favorites of the people in Aberdeenshire
that I know. I took it first down from the
memory of a very old woman, and afterwards
published thirty thousand copies of it. There
are two versions, an old and a new; but, although
I have both, I prefer this one, the
younger of the two, having been composed
and acted in the year 1674.” Laing, who reprints
<b>A</b> in his Thistle of Scotland, p. 63, calls
that the “old way of Andrew Lammie.”
Motherwell, 1827, reprints “a stall-copy published
at Glasgow several years ago, collated
with a recited copy which has furnished one
or two verbal improvements:” <b>C b</b>. There
are a great many variations from <b>C a</b>, of which
precisely one or two are verbal improvements.
But Motherwell also gives six stanzas which
are not in <b>a</b>. His copy is repeated in The
Ballad Minstrelsy of Scotland, Glasgow, 1871,
and there the editor says that in a chap-book
printed by J. and M. Robertson, Saltmarket,
Glasgow, 1808, “Andrew Lammie is given
with only a few slight verbal differences between
it and the copy here printed.” Such
stall-copies as I have seen are late, and are
reprints of <b>C a</b> or of <b>C b</b>. Motherwell assures
us that the ballad as he has given it
“agrees with any recited copy which the Editor
has hitherto met with in the West Country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A professed edition, “most carefully collated
with all previous editions,” was published
at Peterhead, 1872: “Mill o Tifty’s
Annie, A Buchan Ballad, with Introduction,”
etc. This is attributed to the Rev. Dr
John Muir of Aberdeen. ‘Mill o Tiftie’s
Annie’ in Christie, I, 48 “is epitomized from
traditional copies;” that is to say, it is taken
from Motherwell, with a trifling change here
and there. A copy given in Smith’s New
History of Aberdeenshire is compounded of
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and a couple of lines from <b>C b</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Annie, daughter to a well-to-do miller, loses
her heart to a handsome trumpeter in the service
of Lord Fyvie. Her father will not hear
of such a match. (Annie has five thousand
marks, and the man not a penny, <b>A</b> 11.) The
trumpeter is obliged to go to Edinburgh for a
time, and Annie appoints him a tryst at a
bridge. He will buy her her wedding-gear
while he is away, and marry her when he
comes back. Annie knows that she shall be
dead ere he returns, and bids him an everlasting
adieu.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c017'><sup>[130]</sup></a> The trumpeter goes to the top of
the castle and blows a blast which is heard at
his love’s house. Her father beats her, her
mother beats her; her brother beats her and
breaks her back. Lord Fyvie is passing on one
of these occasions, comes in, and urges Mill of
Tiftie to yield to his daughter’s inclinations.
The father is immovable; she must marry
higher than with a trumpeter. Annie is put
to bed, with her face towards Fyvie, and dies
of a broken heart and of the cruel treatment
which she has undergone.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is a homely ditty,<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c017'><sup>[131]</sup></a> but the gentleness
and fidelity of Annie under the brutal behavior
of her family are genuinely pathetic,
and justify the remarkable popularity which
the ballad has enjoyed in the north of Scotland.
In those parts the story has been
played as well as sung. “The ballad used in
former times to be presented in a dramatic
shape at rustic meetings in Aberdeenshire,”
says Chambers (Scottish Ballads, p. 143);
perhaps misinterpreting and expanding the
enunciation made by Buchan and in the title
of some stall-copies that “this tragedy was
acted in the year 1674,” which may rather
refer to the date of the story. But however
it may have been in former times, two rival
companies in Aberdeenshire were performing
plays founded on the ballad in 1887–8.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c017'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“Bonny Andrew Lammie” was a well-known
personage at the beginning of the last
century, for, as Jamieson has pointed out, he
is mentioned in a way that implies this by
Allan Ramsay, in the second of his two cantos
in continuation of Christ’s Kirk on the Green,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>written, as Ramsay says, in 1718. (Poems,
London, 1731, I, 76, v. 70.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Mill of Tiftie is, or was, a farm-house on
the side of a glen about half a mile northeast
of the castle of Fyvie, and in view of its turrets
(on one of which there now stands a
figure of the Trumpeter sounding towards
Tiftie). The mill proper, now a ruin, was in
the bottom of the glen, and gave its name to
the house. The bridge of Sleugh, otherwise
Skeugh, etc., was in the hollow between Tiftie
and the castle.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c017'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Annie was Agnes Smith, Nannie being
among her people an affectionate form for
Agnes. There is reason to believe that she
may have been daughter of a William Smith
who is known to have been a brother or near
kinsman of the laird of Inveramsay, a person
of some local consequence.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c017'><sup>[134]</sup></a> An inscription
on her gravestone makes Agnes Smith to have
died January 19, 1673.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c017'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“Some years subsequent to the melancholy
fate of poor Tifty’s Nanny,” says Jamieson,
II, 387, citing the current tradition of Fyvie,
“her sad story being mentioned and the ballad
sung in a company in Edinburgh when
[Andrew Lammie] was present, he remained
silent and motionless, till he was discovered
by a groan suddenly bursting from him and
<i>several of the buttons flying from his waistcoat</i>.”
The peasants of Fyvie, Jamieson continues,
“borrowed this striking characteristic
of excessive grief” neither from the Laocoön
group nor from Shakspere’s King Lear, but
from nature. The anecdote, and the comment
too, is apt to be repeated by editors of ‘Andrew
Lammie.’ That “affecting image of
overpowering grief,” as Chambers calls it, the
flying off of the buttons (or the bursting of a
waistcoat), we have had several times already,
though in no ballad (or version) of much
note: see II, 118, <b>D</b> 17, 186, <b>C</b> 15, 308, 4;
IV, 101, I 15, 185, 11. It must be owned to
be a stroke that does not well bear iteration.
Mrs. Littlewit in ‘Bartholomew Fair’ has a
tedious life with her Puritan, she says: “he
breaks his buttons and cracks seams at every
saying he sobs out.” Ben Jonson has taken
out one of the best things in our tragedy and
put it into his comedy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The air to which this ballad was usually
sung, Jamieson informs us, was “of that class
which in Teviotdale they term a northern
drawl; and a Perthshire set of it, but two
notes lower than it is commonly sung, is to be
found in Johnson’s Scots Musical Museum
[No. 175, p. 183], to the song ‘How long
and dreary is the night.’”</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'><b>A.</b> ‘Charlie MacPherson,’ Harris MS., fol. 23 b.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> ‘Charlie M’Pherson,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the North
of Scotland, I, 85.</p>

<p class='c010'>Charlie Macpherson comes to Kinaldie
with a large party of men from the West Isle
to take away Helen, whom he has long
courted, <b>A</b> 1, 4. Helen’s mother is obliged
to admit them. When her daughter is asked
for, MacPherson is told that she has gone to
Whitehouse, to marry auld Gairn, <b>A</b> 5 (Dalgairn,
<b>B</b> 12). The party go on to Whitehouse,
where indeed they find Helen, and everybody
there calling her bride. We expect
a collision, and judging by <b>A</b> 8 there was one,
with the bride wishing well to the assailants.
But in <b>B</b> (where there is no hint that Helen
favors her irregular suitor), MacPherson comports
himself very mildly, and only wishes, as
he goes off, that his heavy heart may light on
Whitehouse of Cromar.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ballad was known to Mrs Brown of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Falkland.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c017'><sup>[136]</sup></a> She gives it the title of ‘The
Carrying-off of the Heiress of Kinady,’ from
which it is warrantable to conclude that MacPherson
was so far successful.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are several Kinaldies and more than
one Whitehouse. The Kinaldie which we
have to do with here is a small place in the
parish of Logie-Coldstone, Cromar. Milton
of Whitehouse is about a mile to the south of
Kinaldie, and seems to be the place intended
by Whitehouse o Cromar, <b>B</b> 18, 20. Braemar,
<b>A</b> 7<sup>1</sup>, should then be Cromar.</p>

<p class='c010'>The copy in The New Deeside Guide, by
James Brown [Joseph Robertson], Aberdeen,
1832, p. 26, is <b>B a</b> with a few editorial
changes. It is repeated in The Deeside
Guide, Aberdeen, 1889, with slight variations.
The copy in Christie’s Traditional Ballad Airs,
I, 22, is “given from the way the editor has
heard it sung, assisted by Mr Buchan’s copy
in his Gleanings;” in fact, it is <b>B a</b> with unimportant
variations, which must be treated
as arbitrary. Smith’s New History of Aberdeenshire,
I, 207, repeats Aytoun, nearly, and
Aytoun, II, 309, 1859, <b>B a</b>, nearly.</p>

<p class='c011'>None of the versions here given go beyond
1800. Mrs Brown of Falkland, in an unprinted
letter to Alexander Fraser Tytler,
December 23, 1800, offers him ‘The Death of
the Countess of Aboyne,’ which she had heard
sung when a child: see p. 309, note.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A-I.</b> The Earl of Aboyne (who is kind but
careless, <b>E</b>) goes to London without his wife,
and stays overlong. Information comes by
letter that he has married there, <b>B</b>, or that he
is in love with another woman, <b>D</b>. Word is
brought that he is on his way home, and very
near. His lady orders stable-grooms, minstrels,
cooks, housemaids, to bestir themselves,
<b>A-E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, makes a handsome toilet, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, and calls for wine to drink his
health, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>G</b>. She comes down to the
close to take him from his horse, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>,
and bids him thrice welcome. “Kiss me then
for my coming,” says the earl, and surprises
his wife, and all of us, by adding that the morrow
would have been his wedding-day, if he
had stayed in London. The lady gives him an
angry and disdainful answer. This he resents,
and orders his men to mount again; he will
go first to the Bog of Gight to see the Marquis
of Huntly, and then return to London.
The lady attempts, through a servant, to get
permission to accompany him, but is repulsed,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> (misplaced in <b>G</b>). According
to <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> 24, <b>F</b>, the countess languished for
about a twelvemonth, and then died of a broken
heart; but <b>D</b> 25, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, make her death
ensue before or shortly after the earl’s arrival
at the Bog o Gight. Aboyne is very much
distressed at the tidings; he would rather
have lost all his lands than Margaret Irvine,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. He goes to the burial with a
train of gentlemen, all in black from the hose
to the hat, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b> (horse to the hat, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>).</p>

<p class='c011'><b>J.</b> No Earl of Aboyne ever married an Irvine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>and no Earl of Aboyne would have meditated
open bigamy, and have informed his
wife while receiving her welcome home how
near he had come to perpetrating the same.
The historical difficulty and the practical absurdity
are removed by assuming that <b>J</b> alone
has preserved (or restored) the true and original
story, and that all the other copies, beginning
with Mrs Brown’s, which calls the
lady the Countess of Aboyne, have gone
wrong. In <b>J</b>, Peggy Irvine is only Aboyne’s
love, 1<sup>3</sup>, and Aboyne is her true lover, 8<sup>3</sup>.
Aboyne was careless and kind, and kind to
every woman, and Aboyne staid over long in
London, <b>A</b>, and the ladies they did invite him,
<b>H</b>. Under these circumstances, some Aboyne
may have been on the brink of deserting a

<p class='c022'><b>F. a.</b> ‘The Ladye o the Drum,’ Loudon MS., p. 7. <b>b</b>.
‘The Laird o the Drum,’ Macmath MS., p. 13.</p>

<p class='c010'>First taken into a collection by Kinloch,
1827, who remarks that the ballad had been
printed as a broadside in the North, and was
extremely popular. <b>B</b>, the oldest version
that has been recovered, was written down in
1802–3. There are verbal agreements between
<b>B</b>, especially, and a fragment in Herd’s MSS
(I, 55, II, 187, Herd’s Scottish Songs, 1776,
II, 6), and there has been borrowing from one
side or the other. Herd’s fragment belongs
to a ballad of a shepherd’s daughter and an
earl which is preserved in two copies in Motherwell’s
MS. (I, 37, 252). No 397 of The
Musical Museum, communicated to Johnson,
says Stenhouse, by Burns, [1792,] and probably
in a large measure his work, begins with
stanzas which may have been suggested by
the ballad before us or by the other. See an
appendix.</p>

<p class='c011'>The copy in Christie, I, 24, was epitomized
from <b>A b</b>, with some alterations. That in
The Deeside Guide, 1889, p. 17, is Aytoun’s,
compounded of <b>A b</b> and <b>D a</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander Irvine, the young laird of Drum,
says Spalding, was married to the lady Mary
Gordon on December 7, 1643: Memorials of
the Trubles in Scotland, etc., II, 296. Lady
Mary Gordon was fourth daughter to George
the second Marquis of Huntly, and niece to
the Marquis of Argyll. The Laird of Drum
suffered extremely in his worldly fortunes
through his fidelity to the cause of the Stuarts.
This would have been a natural reason
for his declining a peerage offered him at the
Restoration, and for his marrying, the second
time, to win and not to spend. He took for
his second wife Margaret Coutts (<b>A</b> 9), “a
woman of inferior birth and manners, which
step gave great offence to his relations.” (Kinloch.)
He died in 1687. After the death of
Irvine of Drum, Margaret Coutts married Irvine
of Cults. She died in 1710, at the age
of only forty-five.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c017'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>A copy of <b>a</b> was reprinted by Ritson, Scotish

Duke of Gordon has three daughters,’ No 419,
p. 431, 1797 (with a single variation and the

Minstrel, IV, 98, repeats the stanzas in the
Museum, inserting a few words to fill out
lines for singing. Christie, Traditional Ballad
Airs, I, 2, has made up a ballad from three
“traditional” copies. A fragment of four
stanzas in Notes and Queries, Second Series,
VII, 418, requires no notice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Burns gave the first stanza as follows (Cromek’s
Reliques, p. 229, ed, 1817; Cromek’s
Select Scotish Songs, I, 86, 1810):</p>

      <div class='line'>The lord o Gordon had three dochters,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Mary, Marget, and Jean;</div>
      <div class='line'>They wad na stay at bonie Castle Gordon,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But awa to Aberdeen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The first sister’s name is given as Mary in
<b>e</b> also.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is very likely that the recited copies were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>originally learned from print. <b>e</b> and <b>g</b> have
two stanzas which do not appear in <b>a-d</b>, but
these may occur in some other stall-copy,
or have been borrowed from some other ballad.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ritson pointed out that George Gordon, the
fourth Earl of Huntly, killed at Corrichie in
1562, had three daughters, named Elizabeth,
Margaret, and Jean, and that Jean, the youngest,
married Alexander Ogilvie, Laird of
Boyne. These facts, however, can have no
relevancy to this ballad. Ogilvie was Lady
Jean Gordon’s third husband, and at the death
of the second, in 1594, she was in her fiftieth
year, or near to that. Her marriage with the
Laird of Boyne was “for the utility and profit
of her children,” of which she had a full
quiver.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c017'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Jean, one of the three daughters of the Duke
of Gordon (there was no Duke of Gordon before
1684, but that is early enough for our
ballad), falls in love with Captain Ogilvie at
Aberdeen. Her father threatens to have the
captain hanged, and writes to the king to ask
that favor. The king refuses to hang Ogilvie,
but reduces him to the ranks, makes him a
‘single’ man. The pair lead a wandering life
for three years, and are blessed with as many
children. At the end of that time they journey
afoot to the Highland hills, and present
themselves at Castle Gordon in great destitution.
Lady Jean is welcomed; the duke will
have nothing to do with Ogilvie. Ogilvie
goes over seas as a private soldier, but is soon
after sent for as heir to the earldom of Northumberland.
The duke is now eager to open
Castle Gordon to the Captain. Ogilvie wants
nothing there but Jean Gordon, whom, with
her three children, he takes to Northumberland
to enjoy his inheritance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing in the story of the ballad is known
to have even a shadow of foundation in fact.</p>

on a MS. version communicated to Mr

dated Brechin, April 9th, 1829, and there
given by him as taken down from the recitation
of the amiable daughter of a clergyman

Glenlogie (Earl Ogie, <b>F</b>, Glenogie, <b>I b</b>),

though much flattered, is obliged to say that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>he is already promised.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c017'><sup>[140]</sup></a> Jean takes to her

<b>A</b><a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c017'><sup>[141]</sup></a>), as all too frequently happens at such
conjunctures, proposes the miserable comfort
of another and a better match, and, as usual,
is told to hold his tongue. The chaplain of
the family (the father himself is a king’s chaplain
in <b>F</b>) takes the business in hand, and
writes a broad, long, and well-penned letter
to Glenlogie, setting forth the desperate condition
of the girl. Glenlogie is so much affected
that he rides to Bethelnie with all
haste and presents himself to Jean as her
bridegroom, although promised awa.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>A.</b> ‘Lord Salton and Auchanachie.’ <b>a.</b> Buchan’s Ballads
of the North of Scotland, II, 133. <b>b.</b> Maidment’s
North Countrie Garland, p. 10; Buchan’s
Gleanings, p. 161.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B. a.</b> ‘Young Annochie,’ Murison MS., p. 76. <b>b.</b> ‘Lord
Saltoun and Annachie,’ Christie’s Traditional Ballad
Airs, I, 10.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>A.</b> Jeanie Gordon loves Auchanachie,
who is bonny and braw, but she is forced by
her father to wed Saltoun, who is bowed in
the back and thrawin in the knee; and all
for Saltoun’s lands. Jeanie refuses to be bedded;
her maidens, at her father’s order, loose
off her gown (they cut her gown and stays);
she falls in a swoon and dies. Auchanachie
comes home from the sea the same day, learns
what has happened, asks to be taken to the
chamber where Jeanie lies, kisses her cold lips,
and dies.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>B</b> we have Gordon of Annachie in Buchan,
instead of Gordon of Auchanachie in
Strathbogie as in <b>A</b>. Christie, on very slight
grounds, suggests that one Garden of Annachie
was the proper hero: I, 287, 294.</p>

<p class='c011'>There can hardly be a doubt that this ballad
is Mrs Brown of Falkland’s ‘Lass o Philorth’
(see note, p. 309). Philorth is the seat of the
Frasers of Saltoun, near Fraserburgh, in the
extreme northeast corner of Aberdeenshire.</p>

preceding ballad, p. 339.</p>

<p class='c011'>A young woman (Maggie in <b>B</b>) has played
cards and dice with a rantin laddie till she
has won a bastard baby. Slighted now by all
her friends, she sends a letter to the rantin
laddie, who is the Earl of Aboyne, to inform
him of her uncomfortable circumstances. The
Earl of Aboyne, struck with pity and indignation,
sets out at once with five hundred
men, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, or a select company of gentlemen
and ladies, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, and brings her home as his
wife.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>C</b> 24 is perhaps derived   from   ‘Geordie,’

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> ‘Laird o Leys,’ Kinloch’s Ballad Book, p. 74.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>C.</b> ‘The Baron o Leys,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the North
of Scotland, II, 144.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The Baron o Leys,’ in The New Deeside
Guide by James Brown [==Joseph Robertson],
Aberdeen [1832], p. 15, and The Deeside
Guide, Aberdeen, 1889, p. 23, is <b>C</b>. <b>C</b>
4–11 seems to be an interpolation by a later
hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Part of this ballad,” says Buchan, II, 322,
“by ballad-mongers has been confused with
the ballad of ‘The Earl of Aboyne’ [No 240,
<b>A b</b>], called in some instances ‘The Ranting
Laddie.’” Laing, Thistle of Scotland,
p. 11, appears to have confounded it with
‘The Earl of Aboyne’ proper. He gives this
stanza:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Some ca me that and some ca me this,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>They ca me The Rantin Laddie.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Herd’s MSS, I, 233, II, fol. 71, give the two
following stanzas under the title ‘The Linkin
Ladie:’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Wae’s me that eer I made your bed!</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Shame fa them wad eer hae bade ye!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>‘The Linkin Ladie,’ judging from this fragment
(as it may be supposed to be), was much
of a fashion with the ballad which we are
engaged with, and may have been an earlier
form of it. Sir Walter Scott, who cites
these verses from memory (Sharpe’s Ballad
Book, ed. 1880, p. 162), says that the hero
of them was a brother of the celebrated
[Thomas] Boston, author of ‘The Fourfold
State.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The Baron o Leys’ relates, or purports to
relate, to an escapade of one of the Burnetts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>of Leys, Kincardineshire, Alexander, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
George, <b>C</b>. A woman who is with child by
him gives him his choice of marriage, death,
or the payment of ten thousand crowns. He
is a married man; his wife is ready to sell
everything, to her silk gowns, to release her
husband from his awkward position.</p>

  <h2 id='c242' class='c009'>242<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>THE  COBLE  O  CARGILL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'>‘The Coble o Cargill,’ Motherwell’s MS., p. 80; ‘The
Weary Coble o Cargill,’ Motherwell’s Minstrelsy,
p. 230. Communicated to Motherwell by William
George, tenant in Cambus Michael, Perthshire, who
took it from the recitation of an old woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stobhall is on the left bank of the Tay,
eight miles above Perth, in Cargill parish, and
Cargill is a little further up. Balathy is opposite
Cargill, and Kercock is higher up the
river on the right bank. The local tradition,
as given by Motherwell in his manuscript and
his book, is that the butler of Stobhall had a
leman both at Kercock and at Balathy. Upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>an occasion when the butler had gone to Kercock,
the lass of Balathy scuttled the coble,
which he had left below, “and waited his return,
deeming that her suspicions of his infidelity
would be well founded if he took the boat
without visiting her in passing.” The butler
took the boat without stopping at Balathy,
and in her sight the weary coble sank. Local
tradition in such cases seldom means more
than a theory which people have formed to
explain a preëxisting ballad. The jealousy
of the lass of Balathy has, in the ballad,
passed the point at which confirmation would
be waited for. She has many a time watched
late for her chance to bore the coble, and
she bores it ‘wi gude will.’</p>

<p class='c011'>St. 14 is a commonplace which has been
already several times noted.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Rev. William Marshall’s Historic
Scenes in Perthshire, Edinburgh, 1879, p. 246,
gives us a “modern” version of this ballad;
that is, one written over in magazine style.
This is repeated in Robert Ford’s Auld Scots
Ballants, 1889, p. 152. The Perthshire Antiquarian
Miscellany, by Robert S. Fittis, Perth,
1875, p. 466, cites some stanzas from another
ballad, composed by one James Beattie, journeyman-mason,
but represented as having
been taken down verbatim from the mouth of
an old man. In these pieces the lass of Balathy
has the name Jean, Jeanie Low (Low or
Gow, according to Ford, p. 149).<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c017'><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It will be observed that each of the versions
<b>B-F</b> adds something which is taken up
by a successor or successors. The arrangement
of <b>E</b> and <b>F</b>, of <b>E</b> especially, is objectionable.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A.</b> Jane Reynolds and James Harris, a seaman,
had exchanged vows of marriage. The
young man was pressed as a sailor, and after
three years was reported as dead; the young
woman married a ship-carpenter, and they
lived together happily for four years, and had
children. One night when the carpenter was
absent from home, a spirit rapped at the window
and announced himself as James Harris,
come after an absence of seven years<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c017'><sup>[144]</sup></a> to
claim the woman for his wife. She explained
the state of things, but upon obtaining assurance
that her long-lost lover had the means
to support her—seven ships upon the sea—consented
to go with him, for he was really
much like unto a man. ‘The woman-kind’
was seen no more after that; the carpenter
hanged himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>The carpenter is preserved  in <b>B-E</b>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>even his name in <b>C</b>. He swoons in <b>B</b>, and
runs distracted in <b>C</b>, when he learns what has
become of his wife; the other versions take
no notice of him after the elopement. <b>B-F</b>
all begin with the return of the long-absent
lover. The ship (as it <i>is</i> to have in <b>A</b> 26) has
silken sails and gold masts, or the like, <b>C</b> 10,
<b>F</b> 9<sup>3,4</sup> (<i>cf.</i> <b>B</b> 8, <b>G</b> 1); but there are no visible
mariners, <b>F</b> 9<sup>1,2</sup>, <b>G</b> 4<sup>3,4</sup>. The pair have been
only a short time afloat when the woman begins
to weep for son, husband, or both, <b>B</b> 9,
10, <b>C</b> 14, <b>D</b> 5, <b>E</b> 12, 13, <b>G</b> 5. The seaman
(as it will be convenient to call him) tells her
to hold her tongue, he will show her how the
lilies grow on the banks of Italy, <b>C</b> 16, <b>D</b> 6
(<i>cf.</i> <b>E</b> 16, 17), <b>F</b> 12, and, in a different connection,
<b>G</b> 6. The seaman’s countenance
grows grim, and the sea gurly, <b>D</b> 7, <b>E</b> 10,
<b>F</b> 10, <b>G</b> 8. He will let her see the fishes
swim, where the lilies grow, in the bottom of
the sea, <b>C</b> 21, <b>D</b> 8 (<i>cf.</i> <b>E</b> 16, 17). She discerns
that the seaman has a cloven foot, <b>E</b> 11,
<b>F</b> 11, <b>G</b> 7. She asks, What is yon bright
hill? It is the hill of heaven, where she will
never be. What is yon dark hill? It is the
hill of hell, where they two shall be: <b>E</b> 14,
15, <b>F</b> 13, 14. The seaman reaches his hand
to the topmast, strikes the sails, and the ship
drowns, C 22; takes the woman up to the topmast
and sinks the ship in a flash of fire, <b>E</b> 18;
strikes the topmast with his hand, the fore-mast
with his knee, and sinks the ship, <b>F</b> 15.
In <b>E</b> 9 he throws the woman into the main, and
five-and-twenty hundred ships are wrecked;
in <b>G</b> 9 the little ship runs round about and
never is seen more.</p>

<p class='c011'>In A the <i>revenant</i> is characterized as a
spirit; in <b>B</b>, which is even tamer than <b>A</b>, he
is called the mariner, and is drowned with the
woman; in <b>C</b> he expressly says to the woman,
I brought you away to punish you for breaking
your vows to me. This explicitness may
be prosaic, but it seems to me regrettable that
the conception was not maintained. To explain
the eery personality and proceedings of
the ship-master, <b>E-G</b>, with a sort of vulgar
rationalism, turn him into the devil, and as
he is still represented in <b>E</b>, <b>F</b> (<b>G</b> being defective
at the beginning) as returning to seek
the fulfilment of old vows, he there figures as
a “dæmon lover.” <b>D</b> (probably by the fortunate
accident of being a fragment) leaves us
to put our own construction upon the weird
seaman; and, though it retains the homely
ship-carpenter, is on the whole the most satisfactory
of all the versions.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c017'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><b>A.</b> ‘Sir Fenwick’ steals the king’s jewels
and lays the blame on James Hatley, who
is condemned to death. The king’s daughter
steals the prison-keys from under her father’s
head and pays a visit to Hatley, who assures
her of his innocence, and tells her that Fenwick
is the man. [<b>b</b>, the king is angry, and says
that for stealing his jewels Hatley shall die
‘over the barriers:’ so <b>B</b>.] The princess goes
to her father and begs the life of Hatley, and
her boon is granted without demur. She asks
one thing more, that Fenwick and Hatley may
try their verity at the sword, and this is unhesitatingly
conceded. Hatley is but fifteen
years old (he is seventeen <b>b</b>, eighteen <b>c</b>, fifteen
again <b>C</b>), and Fenwick is thirty-three;
nevertheless, Fenwick gets three wounds. An
English lord intermits: he would have given
all his estates rather than Hatley should escape;
a Scots lord replies that he would have
fought to the knees in blood before Hatley
should have been hanged. (The Scots lord is
wanting in b; the passage is likely to be borrowed
from ‘Geordie,’ No 209.) The king’s
eldest son asks Hatley to dine,  and makes
him his captain by land and sea;<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c017'><sup>[146]</sup></a> the king’s
daughter invites him to dine, and announces
that she has made a vow to marry no other
man.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>B.</b>  Hatley, accused of stealing the king’s
jewels, goes to the little prince and asks what
he will do for his page; the prince goes to his
father and asks what <i>he</i> will do for the page.
The king says that Hatley has stolen his jewels,
so a Norland lord has informed him, and
Hatley must die ‘over the barriers.’ The
prince offers to fight any man who lays the
blame on Hatley. Fenwick maintains that
Hatley is the thief. The prince gives Fenwick
two or three mortal wounds; Fenwick hands
him the key of his coffer, and in the coffer
the jewels will be found. The king invests
Hatley with Fenwick’s lands.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>C.</b> A false knight, Phenix, steals the queen’s
jewels, and leaves the blame on Jamie O’Lee.
The king sends for his son and tells him that
Jamie has been accused of the theft by an
English lord, and shall be banished from Scotland.
The prince demands a man to fight
with Jamie on this charge, and false Phenix
offers himself. The prince at first objects, for
Jamie is but fifteen years old, whereas Phenix
is of course thirty-three; however, he tells
Jamie that he must fight or be banished from
<i>England</i> (8, compare 14). Jamie protests his
innocence. He fights with Phenix and receives
the first wound, then runs Phenix through the
body; Phenix owns his guilt. The king tells
Jamie to come home with him; every knight
in the court shall be at his command. The
queen bids Jamie come home with her; he
shall have a new livery every month. The
prince invites Jamie to come home with him;
all his lands in Scotland shall be at Jamie’s
command. Jamie thanks king, queen, and
nobility; he has been a prince’s page all his
life, and a prince’s page he still will be.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'><b>A.</b> Skene MS., p. 33.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> ‘Young Allan,’ Buchan’s MSS, II, 182.</p>

Scotland, II, 11.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>D.</b> ‘Young Allan,’ Murison MS., p. 117.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>E.</b> ‘Earl Patrick,’ Kinloch MSS, V, 395.</p>

<p class='c010'>The copy in Christie’s Traditional Ballad
Airs, I, 252, is abridged from <b>C</b>, with half a
dozen arbitrary and insignificant changes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Skippers (lords) of Lothain, <b>A</b>, of Scarsburgh,
<b>C</b>, of Aberdeen, <b>D</b>, are bragging over
their drink: some, absurdly enough, of their
hawks and hounds, <b>A-C</b>, some of their ladies,
young Allan of his ship, which will outsail all
others but three.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c017'><sup>[147]</sup></a> A boy in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, says that
his master has a boat (it is a coal-carrier in
<b>C</b>) which will take the wind from him. A
wager is laid, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. All the rest go to
drinking, ‘to the tows,’ but Allan to his prayers,
<b>C</b> 8. They sail; there is a terrible
storm, in the course of which the three competitors
are ‘rent in nine,’ <b>A</b> 9, or two of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>sink, and the topmast of the third ‘gaes in
nine,’ <b>E</b> 7–9.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>A</b> they have sailed only a few leagues,
when Allan’s ship is so racked by the storm
that they see water through her sides. At
this point, especially in <b>A</b>, Allan’s seamanship
appears to very little advantage; he is more
of a fair-weather yachtsman than of a skeely
skipper. If he could get a bonny boy to take
the helm and bring the ship in safe, the boy
should have a liberal share of his gold and
land, and a daughter Ann besides, whom one
is surprised that Young Allan should have to
offer. In <b>A</b> and <b>D</b> the bonny boy evidently
takes command of the ship, although in <b>A</b> 18
the sailors ascribe their safety, under God, to
their good master. The ballad indeed suffers
almost as grievously as the comely cog.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <b>B-E</b> Allan calls for a bonny boy to take
the helm while he goes to the masthead to
look for land. In <b>D</b> he makes the same promises
as in <b>A</b>, but the bonny boy cares only for
Ann. In <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> the bonny boy suggests that
Allan should waken his drunken men, for
whom good thick shoes had been bought,
though none had been given him. But in all
the boy takes the helm, and in fact keeps it
till the ship is in. Allan, at the masthead, can
see neither day nor landmark; many feather-beds
are floating on the water, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. The
boy calls his master down; the sea can be
seen through the ship’s sides, <b>B-E</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Orders are given, by the boy or by Allan
(by the boy certainly in <b>D</b>, and by Allan in
<b>E</b>), to take feather-beds and canvas and lay,
busk, or wrap the ship round; pitch and tar
are also recommended in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. This done,
Allan addresses the ship: Spring up, and gold
shall be your hire, <b>A</b>; Haste to dry land, and
every nail that is in you shall be a gold pin, <b>B</b>;
For every iron nail in you, of gold there shall
be ten, <b>C</b>; in <b>D</b>, indirectly, Where she wants
an iron nail drive in a silver pin, and where
she wants an oaken bolt beat in the gold, and
the like in <b>E</b>. When the ship hears this, she
springs from the water like sparks from the
fire, <b>A-C</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first shore they come to is Troup, <b>B</b>,
Howdoloot, <b>C</b>, Linn, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>. The ship is kept off
with cannon, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, with spears and bayonets,
<b>D</b>; is towed in (wrongly), <b>E</b>. The next shore
they come to is Lee, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, Howdilee, <b>C</b>, wanting
in <b>D</b>; ‘they bare her to the sea,’ <b>C</b>, ‘they
turned their ship about,’ <b>D</b>, the ship is towed
in (wrongly), <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>. The third shore they
come to is Lin, <b>B</b>, Howdilin, <b>C</b>, Aberdeen,
<b>D</b>; the ship is towed in (welcomed), with
drums beating and pipes playing, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Allan calls for the bonny boy that brought
the ship safe in, that took the helm in hand,
and offers him gold, land, and his daughter;
the boy rejects gold and land, and takes the
daughter, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>; Allan makes over to the boy
his comely cog and gives him his daughter, <b>B</b>;
gives him his daughter, <b>C</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Five-and-forty ships, <b>A</b>, three-and-fifty, <b>C</b>,
one-and-twenty, <b>E</b>, went to sea, and only one
came back.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c017'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>This ballad is mixed with that of ‘Sir Patrick
Spens,’ No 58, II, 21 ff. <b>E</b> 1–6 belong
entirely to No 58, and <b>K</b> 6–10, <b>M</b> 1, 3, of No
58 belong to ‘Young Allan.’ The bonny boy
is found in 58, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>; the floating
feather-beds occur in <b>E-H</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>R</b>; the
sea is seen through the ship in 58, <b>C</b> 15, <b>I</b>
21; cloth is wapped into the ship’s side to
keep out water, <b>H</b> 19, 20; feather-beds and
canvas (and pitch) are used as here in <b>I</b> 22,
23.</p>

<p class='c011'>By far the most interesting feature in this
ballad is Allan’s addressing his ship and the
ship’s intelligent behavior, <b>A</b> 16, 17, <b>B</b> 12–15,
<b>C</b> 21–22. Friðþjóf’s ship Elliða understood
and obeyed the speech of its master: Fornaldar
Sogur, II, 79, 443 (cited by Bugge).
Ranild’s ship came to him when he blew his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>horn: ‘Svend Ranild,’ Grundtvig, No 28, I,
367 (translated by Prior, I, 286). In another
Danish ballad, and one of the best, the Ox
when sailed by St Olav, responds to his commands
as if fully endowed with consciousness;
he thwacks it in the side and over the eye, and
it goes faster and faster; but it is animate
only for the nonce: ‘Hellig-Olavs Væddefart,’
Grundtvig, No 50, II, 134, Prior, I, 356.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Phæacian ships have neither helmsman
nor helm, and know men’s minds and the way
to all cities: Odyssey, viii, 557 ff. There is a
magical self-moving ship in Marie de France’s
Guigemar, and elsewhere.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'><b>A.</b> ‘Reedisdale and Wise William,’ Buchan’s Ballads
of the North of Scotland, II, 70; Motherwell’s MS.,
p. 452; Motherwell’s Minstrelsy, p. 298.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> ‘Roudesdales,’ Harris MS., fol. 14 b.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>C.</b> Kinloch MSS, V, 423, two stanzas.</p>

<p class='c010'>Redesdale boasts to William that he can
win any woman with a blink of his eye. William
has a sister who, he maintains, is not to
be had so easily. A wager is laid, William’s
head against Redesdale’s lands. William is
shut up to prevent his warning his sister, but
sends her a letter by a carrier-bird. Redesdale
rides to the maiden’s bower, and, seeing her
at the window, tries to induce her to come
down by a series of offers of silk-gowns, jewels,
etc. His offers proving bootless, he threatens
to fire the house, and does so. The maid
and her women don wet mantles and pass the
reek and flame unhurt. She sends word to
her brother, who claims Redesdale’s lands.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A</b> 1, 2, 5 are substantially a repetition of
No 245, <b>A</b> 1, 2<sup>1,4</sup>, 6, etc. The sharp shower
in <b>B</b> 16–18, which puts out, and does not put
out, the fire, is an inept interpolation.</p>

<p class='c011'>This ballad may be an offshoot from a
widely spread story which is tediously told
further on in ‘Twa Knights.’</p>

  <h2 id='c247' class='c009'>247<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>LADY ELSPAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'>‘Lady Elspat.’ <b>a.</b> Jamieson-Brown MS., p. 19.
Printed in Jamieson’s Popular Ballads, II, 191.  <b>b.</b>
“Scottish Songs,” MS., fol. 30, Abbotsford Library,
N. 3, in the handwriting of Walter Scott, about 1795</p>

<p class='c010'>This ballad was No 10 of the fifteen of Mrs
Brown’s which were obtained by William
Tytler from Professor Thomas Gordon in
1783: Anderson to Percy, December 29, 1800,
in Nichols’s Illustrations, VII, 177, where the
first stanza (of twelve) is cited. These transcripts
were accompanied with the airs. In <b>b</b>,
which is now ascertained to be in the handwriting
of Walter Scott,<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c017'><sup>[149]</sup></a> there is a mawkish
stanza after 4, and another after 9, which do
not occur in <b>a</b>, and many verbal variations.
These two stanzas are not likely to have been
inserted by Scott, for, so far as we know, the
ballad has been preserved only by Mrs Brown.
As for the other variations, we are not in a
condition to say which are Mrs Brown’s, which
Scott’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>An appointment for an elopement made by
Lady Elspat with Sweet William is revealed
to her mother by an eavesdropping page.
William is bound with his own bow-string
and brought before the Lord Justice. The
mother accuses him of stealing her jewels;
Lady Elspat denies this, and says that his only
crime is too small an estate. The judge sees
no fault in the young man (whom he discovers
to be his sister’s son!), hands him over to
Lady Elspat, and promises the pair as much
land as a valuable horse of his can ride about
in a summer’s day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Truly not impressive in story or style, and
very fit to have been forgotten by Mrs Brown.</p>

</div>
<p class='c021'><b>a.</b>.’The Grey Cock,’ Herd’s Ancient and Modern Scots
Songs, 1769, p. 324; Herd’s MSS, I, 4; Herd’s Ancient
and Modern Scottish Songs, 1776, II, 208.  <b>b.</b>
‘Saw you my father?’ Chappell’s Popular Music,
p. 731</p>

<p class='c010'>Stanzas 1, 4, 6, 7, are printed in Herd,
1769; the three others are among the “Additions
to songs in the former volume” [of
1769], at the beginning of the first volume of
the MS.; the whole is given in Herd, 1776.</p>

<p class='c011'>Repeated from Herd, 1776 (with a change
or two) in Pinkerton’s Select Scotish Ballads
II, 155, 1783, and in Johnson’s Museum, p.
77, No 76, 1787, ‘O saw ye my father?’
Stenhouse had not found the verses in any collection
prior to that of Herd, but asserts that
the song had been “a great favorite in Scotland
for a long time past” (1820, Museum,
ed. 1853, IV, 81).</p>

<p class='c011'>“This song,” says Chappell, “is printed on
broadsides, with the tune, and in Vocal Music,
or the Songster’s Companion, II, 36, second
edition, 1772. This collection was printed by
Robert Horsfield, in Ludgate Street, and probably
the words and music will also be found in
the first edition, which I have not seen.” The
words, he adds, are in several “Songsters.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Three stanzas from recitation, wrongly attached
to ‘The Broomfield Hill,’ No 43, <b>E</b>,
have been given at p. 399 of the first volume
of this collection. Much of the ballad has
been adopted into ‘Willie’s Fatal Visit,’
Buchan’s Ballads of the North of Scotland, II,
259, the two concluding stanzas with little
change. These two stanzas are given by a correspondent<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c017'><sup>[150]</sup></a>
of Notes and Queries, First Series,
XII, 227, as heard by him in the nursery
about 1787. They have been made the kernel
of a song by Allan Cunningham, impudently
put forward as “the precious relique of the
original,” Cromek, Remains of Nithsdale and
Galloway Song, 1810, p. 72.</p>

<p class='c011'>The injunction to the cock is found in
‘The Swain’s Resolve,’ Lyle’s Ancient Ballads
and Songs, 1827, p. 142:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She cries to the cock, saying, Thou must not crow</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Until that the day be worn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thy wings shall be made of the silvery gray,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And thy voice of the silver horn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is also cited in Graves’s Irish Songs and
Ballads, London, 1882, p. 249, No 50, as occurring
“in a ballad descriptive of the visit of
a lover’s ghost to his betrothed,” in which the
woman, to protract the interview, says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘O my pretty cock, O my handsome cock,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I pray you do not crow before day,</div>
      <div class='line'>And your comb shall be made of the very beaten gold,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And your wings of the silver so gray.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The cock is remiss or unfaithful, again, in a
little ballad picked up by Burns in Nithsdale,
‘A Waukrife Minnie,’ Cromek, Select Scotish
Songs, 1810, II, 116 (of which another
version is furnished by Lyle, p. 155, ‘The
Wakerife Mammy’):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O weary fa the waukrife cock,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the foumart lay his crawin!</div>
      <div class='line'>He waukend the auld wife frae her sleep</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A wee blink or the dawin.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>The first stanza of ‘The Grey Cock’ seems
to have been suggested by ‘Sweet William’s
Ghost’ (of which the Irish ballad noted by
Graves may have been a variety), as again
is the case in Buchan’s ‘James Herries.’ The
fantastic reward promised the cock in stanza
6 is an imitation, or a corruption, of the bribe
to the parrot in No 4, <b>D</b> 23, <b>E</b> 15, <b>F</b> 10, or in
No 68, <b>A</b> 10, <b>B</b> 13, <b>C</b> 14, etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the same general description is ‘Le
Chant de l’Alouette,’ Victor Smith, Chansons
de Velay, etc., Romania, VII, 56 (see further
note 6 of Smith); ‘Le Rendez-vous,’ Mélusine,
I, 285 ff., Rolland, Recueil, etc., IV, 43,
No 196. Again, ‘La Rondinella,’ Kopisch,
Agrumi, p. 80, 1837; ‘La Visita,’ Wolf,
Volkslieder aus Venetien, p. 8; ‘La Rondine
importuna,’ Ferraro, C. p. monferrini, p. 75,
No 54; ‘Il Furto amoroso’ Gianandrea, C.
p. marchigiani, p. 274; ‘La Rondinella,’
Archivio, VII, 401, No 6. The treacherous
or troublesome bird is in French the
lark, in one case the cock; in Italian the
swallow.</p>

<p class='c011'>This piece is a variety of the <i>aube</i> (concerning
which species see Jeanroy, Les Origines
de la Poésie lyrique en France, the third chapter),
but is none the less quite modern.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>‘Auld Matrons,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 238; Motherwell’s MS., p. 585, with the title</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>‘Love Annie.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Willie tirls at Annie’s bower-door and is
admitted. After the exchange of familiar formulas,
Willie expresses apprehension of “Matrons,”
an old woman who is sitting by the
kitchen-fire. Annie says there is no occasion
to mind the old woman; she has not walked
for seven years. But while the lovers are occupied
with endearments the old woman makes
speed to the sheriff, and informs him that Willie
is with his daughter. The sheriff, guided
by Matrons, goes to the bower, with men in
mail. Annie hears the bridles ring, and wakens
Willie. There is shooting of arrows and
fire is set to the bower (<i>cf.</i> st. 17 and st. 33
of No 116). Willie maintains himself with
spirit, but is so hard pressed that he is fain
to blow his horn for his brother John, who is
lying in Ringlewood. John wounds fifty and
fifteen with his first shot, and with the next
strikes out the sheriff’s eyes. The sheriff orders
a retreat, and threatens, very illogically,
to burn the old woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>This piece was made by some one who had
acquaintance with the first fit of ‘Adam
Bell.’ The anonymous ‘old wife’ becomes
‘auld Matrons;’ Inglewood, Ringlewood.
The conclusion is in imitation of the rescues
in Robin Hood ballads. Stanzas 2–5 are
hacknied commonplaces.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not considerate of Willie to take a
foot-groom with him when he goes to pass a
night at the bower of an unprovided seamstress,
though the seamstress be a gentlewoman
and the daughter of a sheriff. William
of Cloudesly did not so. That the
sheriff’s unmarried daughter should be living
apart from her father is unusual, but a separate
establishment was probably a necessity in
Kelso for a gentlewoman who had ‘her living
by the seam.’</p>

</div>
<p class='c021'><b>A.</b> <b>a, b.</b> ‘Henry Martyn;’ taken down from recitation,
by the Rev. S. Baring-Gould.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> <b>a.</b> A broadside, Catnach, Seven Dials. <b>b.</b> ‘Henry
Martin,’ Kidson, Traditional Tunes, p. 31. <b>c.</b> The
same, p. 30.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>C.</b> ‘Robin Hood,’ Motherwell’s MS., p. 660.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>D.</b> [‘Andrew Bodee’], from New Hampshire, U. S. A.,
communicated by Mr George M. Richardson;  two
stanzas.</p>

<p class='c010'>A copy edited from <b>A</b>, <b>B a</b>, with the addition
of one stanza for a “snapper,” is printed
in Baring-Gould and Sheppard’s Songs and
Ballads of the West, No 53. Four traditional
versions were obtained by Mr Baring-Gould.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three brothers in Scotland cast lots to determine
which of them shall rob on the sea
to maintain them. The lot falls on the youngest,
Henry Martyn, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; Robin Hood, <b>C</b>;
Andrew Bodee, <b>D</b>. The pirate meets and
stops an English ship the very first day (third,
<b>A b</b>; fifth, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>). There is a brisk fight, and
the English ship is sunk by shot, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. She
is plundered and then scuttled, <b>C</b>. In <b>A a</b>,
Henry Martyn gets a deep wound and falls
by the mast.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ballad must have sprung from the ashes
of ‘Andrew Barton,’ of which name Henry
Martyn would be no extraordinary corruption.
Only one copy, <b>A a</b>, preserves the trait of
Barton’s death, an incident not quite in keeping
with the rest of the story of the new ballad.</p>

<p class='c011'>Robin Hood, <b>C</b>, is always at the service of
any ballad-monger who wants a name for his
hero. But it will be remembered that he is
credited with taking a French ship in ‘The
Noble Fisherman,’ No 148, and that is enough
to explain his appearance here. ‘Andrew
Bodee’ may just conceivably be a corruption
of Andrew Wood, who displaces Patrick
Spens in two versions of No 58 (<b>A b</b>, <b>D</b>).
Motherwell knew of a copy in which the hero
was called Roberton: MS., p. 660.</p>

  <h2 id='c251' class='c009'>251<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>LANG JOHNNY MORE</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>‘Lang Johnny Moir,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 248.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>‘Lang Johnny More,’ Christie’s Traditional
Ballad Airs, I, 44, is epitomized from
Buchan, “with a few alterations from the way
the editor has heard it sung.” The variations
are absolutely of no account, as in other cases
in which Christie has used this phrase.</p>

<p class='c011'>Johnny More, a youth fourteen feet tall
and three yards round the waist, goes to London
to bear the king’s banner. He falls in
love with the king’s daughter, and she with
him, and the king locks the lady up in her
chamber and swears that he will hang the
Scot. Johnny laughs at the hanging; but
the English give him laudanum, and when he
wakes he finds his jaws and hands in iron
bands and his feet in fetters. He sends a boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>with a letter asking his uncle to come to his
aid, and to bring with him Jock o Noth.
These champions, ‘twa grizly ghosts to see,’
have three feet between their brows and three
yards between their shoulders. Coming to London
they find the gates locked, because, as they
learn from a keeper, a Scot is to be hanged
that morn. The keeper declining to open
the gates, Jock o Noth drives in three yards
of the wall with his foot. Johnny More is
standing with the rope round his neck, ready
to be turned off. Though the portentous pair
have a giant’s strength, they are quite too superior
to use it like a giant; they tell Johnny
that there is no help for him if he has been
guilty of a heinous crime. Learning that his
only crime is loving a gay lady, they require
that his sword shall be given back to him,
then go before the king and demand the lady;
they have come to her wedding. Take her,
says the king. I never thought to see such
men. Jock of Noth could have brought a
man thrice three times bigger, if he had
supposed that his own size would cause such
astonishment. Any way, says the craven
king, the boy that took the message shall be
hanged. In that case, replies Jock, we shall
attend the burial and see that you get your
reward. The king yields everything. Johnny
More calls for a priest to join him and his
love; the king for a clerk to seal the tocher.
Johnny is rich, and spurns tocher. Auld
Johnny More, Young Johnny More, Jock o
Noth and the boy go off with the lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>This ballad has been referred to under No
99, II, 378, as perhaps an imitation, and in fact
almost a parody, of ‘Johnie Scot.’ In No 99
John is the little Scot; here he is the muckle
Scot, stanza 6 (Gaelic mor==big), and his
helpmates, as well as he, are of gigantic size.
Excepting in this and one other particular,
the stories are materially the same. In both
Johnie goes to England to bear the king’s
banner; a love-affair ensues between him and
the king’s daughter; the king puts his daughter
into confinement, and threatens to hang
Johnie, but in the end is constrained to give
him his daughter; Johnie calls for a priest to
marry him and the princess, the king calls for
a clerk to arrange the tocher; Johnie refuses
tocher, and goes off with his love or bride.</p>

<p class='c011'>In No 99 Johnie, who has escaped, comes
to the rescue of the princess with a redoubtable
force; in this ballad Johnie is made prisoner,
and sends for his uncle and another giant
to come to his help. Their monstrous dimensions
make them, for ballad-purposes, fairly
equivalent to the five hundred men who accompany
Johnie in No 99.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some versions of No 99, as already remarked,
have borrowed features from this
ballad. Auld Johnie and Jock o Noth are
presented here, stanza 21, as twa grizly
ghosts to see, and their brows are three feet
apart, their shoulders three yards; and so with
the champion in <b>A</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, of No 99.</p>

<p class='c011'>Quite curiously, the hero of the Breton
ballad which resembles ‘Johnie Scot’ is
described as a giant (we must suppose on
traditionary authority) in the title of two
copies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Auchindoir and Rhynie (parishes) are in
the west of Aberdeenshire, north of the Don.
Noth is a considerable hill in the latter.</p>

‘Adversaria,’ p. 88.</p>

<p class='c010'>A lady of birth falls in love with her father’s
kitchen-boy (foot-boy, <b>C</b>). She makes
her passion known to him. He begs for secrecy,
for her father would hang him; this
is quite too likely, and she would be sent to
a nunnery. The danger quickens her wits:
she will send him off in a fine ship, and he
can come back ‘like some earl or baron’s
son’ and marry her (<b>C</b>). Being well provided
with gold, her mother’s legacy, she has
no difficulty in carrying out her plan; a very
noble ship is provided, and she gives Willie
(<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>) a ring to mind him of her. She
warns him, <b>C</b> 8, <b>E</b> 13, that there are pressing
reasons why he should not stay away very
long. After a voyage of from three weeks to
twelve months, Willie lands at London, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>;
in Spain, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. A lady, looking over her
castle-wall, sees the ship coming in, and goes
down to the shore with her maries to invite
the master to dine. The master excuses himself;
she asks him if he can fancy her; the
woman he loves is far over the sea; the fairest
woman in Scotland would break her heart
if he should not return to her. The Spanish
(or English) lady offers him a rich ring, to
wear for her sake; he has a ring on his finger
which is far dearer than any she could give
him. He sails homeward; the lady’s father
sees the ship coming in, and is as much impressed
as his daughter could desire; he
thinks some man of mark must be aboard,
and tells his daughter to busk herself, for he
means to ask the squire or lord to dine; he
would give all his rents to have this same
marry his daughter. Willie blackens or paints
or masks or veils his face, and goes with the
father to the castle. He asks the lady if she
can fancy him; her father asks her if she will
marry this lord, <b>C</b>. The man is far over sea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>that shall have her love, she replies. Willie
hands her the ring which she had given him.
Gat ye that by sea? or gat ye that by land?
or gat ye it on the Spanish coast upon a dead
man’s hand? He gat it on a drowned man’s
hand. Alas! she cries, my true-love Willie!
Upon this, Willie reveals himself. The father
calls for a priest, little knowing that this lord
was his own kitchen-boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ballad is a modern “adaptation” of
‘King Horn,’ No 17, from which <b>A</b> 33, 34,
<b>B</b> 47, <b>D</b> 7, 8, are taken outright. In the particular
of the hero’s having his choice of two
women it is more like the <i>gest</i> of ‘King
Horn,’ or ‘Horn Childe and Maiden Rimnild;’
but an independent invention of the
Spanish lady is not beyond the humble ability
of the composer of ‘The Kitchie-Boy.’</p>

  <h2 id='c253' class='c009'>253<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>THOMAS O YONDERDALE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'><b>a.</b> Buchan’s Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 221.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>b.</b> Christie’s Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 96.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>b</b> is epitomized from <b>a</b>, with a few variations,
mostly very trifling, as Christie had
heard the ballad sung.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thomas of Yonderdale gains Lady Maisry’s
love and has a son by her. Overhearing
some reproachful words one day as he passes
her bower, he is touched, and promises to
marry her after returning from a voyage, but
while he is in a strange country wooes another
woman. He dreams that Maisry stands by
his bed upbraiding him for his inconstancy,
and sends a boy to her to bring her to his
wedding. Maisry comes, arrayed, as she had
been directed, in noble style. The bride asks
the boy who she may be, and is told that she
is Thomas’s first love. Maisry asks Thomas
why she was sent for: she is to be his wife.
The nominal bride asks his will: she is to go
home, with the comfort of being sent back in
a coach, whereas she came on a hired horse!
This ill-used, but not diffident, young woman
proposes that Thomas shall give two thirds of
his lands to his brother and make him marry
her. Thomas refuses to divide his lands for
any woman, and has no power over his brother.
According to <b>b</b>, the discarded bride asks only
a modest third of Thomas’s lands for the
brother; Thomas promises to give a third to
<i>her</i>, but disclaims, as in <b>a</b>, his competency to
arrange a marriage for his brother.</p>

<p class='c010'>This looks like a recent piece, fabricated,
with a certain amount of cheap mortar, from
recollections of ‘Fair Annie,’ No 62, ‘Lord
Thomas and Fair Annet,’ No 73, and ‘Young
Beichan,’ No 53.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sweet William (Lord William’s son, or
Lord William) and the Baillie’s daughter
(Lord Lundy’s daughter) have been lovers:
they have in fact been over-sea together, learning
“some unco lair.” The young woman’s
father recalls her from her studies abroad, and
requires her to marry a Southland lord (the
young prince of England). She will submit
to her father’s will, though she had rather die.
In <b>A</b> she sends a letter to William by a bird.
The minister has begun the marriage-service,
when the lover enters the church with a party
of armed men and bids the bridegroom stand
back; the bride shall join with him. The
father fumes; would shoot William if he had
a pistol, <b>A</b>; will give his daughter no dowry,
<b>B</b>. William of course cares not the least
for dowry; he has what he wants. He tells
his ‘foremost man’ to lift his bride on her
horse, and sends commendations to her mother.</p>

    <div>Buchan’s Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 259.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A maid, Meggie, inquires after her lover,
Willie, and is told that he will be with her
at night. Willie tirls the pin and is admitted.
He is given the option of cards, wine,
or bed, and chooses the bed, a too familiar
commonplace in Buchan’s ballads. Meggie
charges the cock not to crow till day, but the
cock crows an hour too soon. Willie dons his
clothes, and in a dowie den encounters a grievous
ghost, which, wan and weary though it be,
smiles upon him; smiles, we may suppose, to
have caught him. Willie has travelled this
road often, and never uttered a prayer for
safety; but he will never travel that road
again. The ghost tears him to pieces, and
hangs a bit ‘on every seat’ of Mary’s kirk,
the head right over Meggie’s pew! Meggie
rives her yellow hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first half of this piece is a medley of
‘Sweet William’s Ghost,’ ‘Clerk Saunders,’
and ‘The Grey Cock.’ For 1<sup>3–6</sup>, 2, compare No
77, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, 2, 3, No 248, 1; for 5–8, No 69, <b>F</b>
3–6, No 70, <b>B</b> 2, 4; for 9, 10, No 248, 6, 7.
13 is caught, or taken, from ‘Clyde’s Water,’
No 216, <b>A</b> 7.</p>

<p class='c011'>Stanzas 15–17, wherever they came from, are
too good for the setting: nothing so spirited,
word or deed, could have been looked for from
a ghost wan, weary, and smiling.</p>

the North of Scotland, I, 76.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>C.</b> ‘Earl Patrick and Burd Isabel,’ Motherwell’s MS.,
p. 440.</p>

<p class='c010'>Christie, Traditional Ballad Airs, II, 34,
I, 42, says that an old woman in Buckie, Enzie,
Banff, who died in 1866 at the age of
nearly eighty, and whose father was a noted
ballad-singer, sang him words which, so far
as he could remember, were like those of <b>B</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span><b>A.</b> Unmarried Burd Isabel bears a son to
Earl Patrick. He has passed his word to
make her his wife in case the expected bairn
should be a boy, but his mother objects. He
now promises to bring her home after the demise
of his parents, and in the mean while
builds her a gold and silver bower (which for a
reason inscrutable is ‘strawn round wi sand’).
Father and mother die; Patrick takes no step
to fulfil his engagement, and Isabel asks why.
Patrick wishes that a hundred evils may enter
him, and he ‘fa oure the brim,’ if ever he marries
another; nevertheless he weds a duke’s
daughter. His bride has a fancy to see his
son, and Patrick sends his aunt (or his grand-aunt,
or his great-grand-aunt) to fetch the
boy. Isabel dares any woman to take the
bairn away. Patrick comes in person. Isabel
repeats the words she had used to his aunt,
and reminds him of the curse which he had
conditionally wished himself at their last interview.
The perjured man turns to go
away, the hundred evils enter him, and he
falls ‘oure the brim.’</p>

<p class='c011'><b>B</b> has nearly the same story with additional
circumstances. Patrick wishes that eleven
devils may attend his last day should he wed
another woman. When he goes to inquire
how Isabel came to refuse the request he had
made through his aunt, he takes the opportunity
to make over to her child the third part
of his land. She has two clerks, her cousins,
at her call, who see to the legal formalities
pertaining to this transfer; she commits the
boy to one of these, and herself goes to an unco
land to drive love out of her mind. We hear
of nothing worse happening to Earl Patrick
for selling his precious soul than his never
getting further ben the church than the door.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>C</b> is a variety of <b>B</b>, but not half so long.
Whether <b>B</b> has added or <b>C</b> omitted, no reader
will much concern himself to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>St. 7 (nearly) occurs in No 92, <b>B</b> 17, II,

fol. 17 b; from Mrs Harris.</p>

<p class='c010'>A young woman is carried off from
Broughty Castle, near Dundee, by a body of
armed Highlanders. Her lover, who is making
her a visit at the time, is either taken along
with her—an unnecessary incumbrance, one
would think—or follows her. The pair go
out to take the air; she throws herself into
a river; her lover leaps in after her and is
drowned. She kilts up her clothes and makes
her way to Dundee, congratulating herself
that she had learned to swim for liberty.</p>

    <div>Maidment’s North Countrie Garland, p. 1.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Lord Thomas Stuart has married a
young countess, and has given her Strathbogie
and Aboyne for a morning-gift. The
lady has a desire to see these places. As they
are on their way thither (from Edinburgh),
her husband is attacked with a pain which
obliges him to turn back; he tells her to ride
on, and she seems so to do. The pain proves
to be beyond the skill of leeches. Lord
Thomas begs his father to see that his wife
gets what he has given her. He dies; the
horses turn wild in the stables, the hounds
howl on the leash. Lady Stuart has the usual
dream (No 74, <b>A</b> 8, <b>B</b> 11, etc.). She comes
back wringing her hands; she knows by the
horses that are standing about the house that
the burial is preparing.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'><b>A. a.</b> ‘Lord Thomas,’ Motherwell’s MS., p. 407.  <b>b.</b>
‘Lord Thomas and Lady Margaret,’ the same, p. 71.</p>

<p class='c022'><b>B.</b> ‘Clerk Tamas,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the North of
Scotland, I, 43.</p>

<p class='c010'>Christie, who gives <b>B</b>, “epitomized and
slightly changed,” under the title ‘Clerk
Tamas and Fair Annie,’ Traditional Ballad
Airs, II, 12, says that he can trace the ballad,
traditionally, far into the last century.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A.</b> Lord Thomas goes a-hunting, and Lady
Margaret rides after him; when he sees her
following, he orders his servants to hunt her
far from him, and they hunt her high and
low. She comes upon a tall young man, and
begs ‘relief’ from him for a lady wronged in
love and chased from her ‘country.’ No relief
is to be had from him unless she will
renounce all other men and be his wife. After
a time, Lady Margaret, sewing at her window,
observes a vagrant body, who turns out
to be Lord Thomas, reduced to beggary;
he has been banished from his own country,
and asks relief. No relief from her; she
would hang him were he within her bower.
Not so, says Lord Thomas; rather he would
kill her lord with his broadsword and carry
her off. Not so, says Lady Margaret, but
you must come in and drink with me. She
poisons three bottles of wine, and pretends
to be his taster. Lord Thomas drinks away
merrily, but soon feels the poison. I am
wearied with this drinking, he says. And
so was I when you set your hounds at me,
she replies; but you shall be buried as if you
were one of my own.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>B</b> has Clerk Tamas for Lord Thomas, and
Fair Annie for Lady Margaret. Tamas has
loved Annie devotedly, but now hates her and
the lands she lives in. Annie goes to ask him
to pity her; he sees her coming, as he lies
‘over his shot-window,’ and orders his men
to hunt her to the sea. A captain, lying
‘over his ship-window,’ sees Annie driven
from the town, and offers to take her in if she
will forsake friends and lands for him. The
story goes on much as in <b>A</b>.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>A</b> 8 is borrowed from ‘The Douglas Tragedy,’
see No 7, <b>C</b> 9. <b>B</b> 14<sup>3,4</sup> is a commonplace,
which, in inferior traditional ballads, is
often, as here, an out-of-place. <b>B</b> 15, 16 is
another commonplace, of the silly sort: see
No 87, <b>B</b> 3, 4, <b>D</b> 4, 5, and Buchan’s ‘Lady
Isabel,’ 20, 21.</p>

    <div>‘Lady Isabel,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 129.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Lady Isabel’s step-mother accuses her of
being her father’s leman; he gives her finer
gowns than he gives his wife. Isabel replies
that, in the first place, she is young, which is
reason enough why her gowns should be
fairer; but that, as a matter of fact, a lover
of hers over seas sends her ten gowns to one
that her father buys her. The step-mother
invites Isabel to take wine with her. Isabel
wishes first to go to a church. At this church
she sees her own mother, and asks whether
she shall flee the country or drink what has
been prepared for her. Her mother enjoins
her to drink the dowie drink; before she is
cold she will be in a better place. Upon returning,
Isabel is again pressed to take wine,
and again begs to be excused for the moment;
she wishes to see her maids in the garden.
She gives her maids ring and brooch. A third
time the step-mother proposes that they shall
take wine together; the daughter, with due
courtesy, begs the elder to begin. The step-mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>goes through certain motions customary
in ballads of this description, and swallows
not a drop; Isabel duly repeats the mummery,
but drinks. She has time to tell this
wicked dame that their beds will be made
very far apart. The step-mother goes mad.</p>

<p class='c011'>Stanzas 20, 21, as has already been intimated,
are a commonplace, and a foolish one.
Stanza 24, in various forms, not always well
adapted to the particular circumstances, ends
several ballads: as No 64, <b>F</b>; No 65, <b>H</b>; No
66, <b>A</b> 28, 29, <b>B</b> 20, 21; No 67, <b>B</b>; No 70, <b>B</b>.</p>

  <h2 id='c262' class='c009'>262<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>LORD  LIVINGSTON</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>‘Lord Livingston,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 39.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As far as can be made out, Livingston and
Seaton engage themselves to play against one
another at some game, the victor expecting to
stand the better in the eyes of a lady. They
then proceed to Edinburgh castle, where a
lady, whose ‘gowns seem like green,’ marshals
the company in pairs, and chooses Livingston
for her own partner. This preference enrages
Seaton, who challenges Livingston to
fight with him the next day. Up to this
point the pairing may have been for a dance,
or what not, but now we are told that Livingston
and the fair dame are laid in the same bed,
and further on that they were wedded that
same night. In the morning Livingston arms
himself for his fight; he declines to let his
lady dress herself in man’s clothes and fight
in his stead. On his way ‘to plain fields’ a
witch warns him that she has had the dream
which Sweet William dreams in No 74, and
others elsewhere. Livingston is ‘slain,’ but
for all that stands presently bleeding by his
lady’s knee: see No 73, <b>B</b> 34, <b>D</b> 17. She
begs him to hold out but half an hour, and
every leech in Edinburgh shall come to him:
see No 88, <b>A</b> 12, etc. He orders his lands to
be dealt to the auld that may not, the young
that cannot, etc.: see No 92, <b>A</b> 10, <b>B</b> 15.
The lady declares that it was known from her
birth that she was to marry a knight and lose
him the next day. She will now do for his
sake what other ladies would not be equal to
(and which nevertheless many other ballad-ladies
have undertaken, as in No 69 and elsewhere).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>When seven years are near an end
her heart breaks.</p>

<p class='c011'>This ballad, or something like it, was
known at the end of the last century. The
story has a faint resemblance to that of ‘Armstrong
and Musgrave,’ a broadside printed in
the last quarter of the seventeenth century:
Crawford Ballads, No 123, Old Ballads, 1723,
I, 175; Evans, Old Ballads, 1777, II, 70.
Pinkerton acknowledges that he composed the
‘Lord Livingston’ of his Tragic Ballads,
1781, p. 69, but he says that he had “small
lines from tradition.” (Ancient Scotish Poems,
1786, I, cxxxi.) Pinkerton’s ballad
is the one which Buchan refers to, II, 308.
It is translated by Grundtvig, Engelske og
skotske Folkeviser, p. 139, No 21.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>‘The New-Slain Knight,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 197.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A knight (who twaddles in the first person
at the beginning) finds a maid sleeping
under a hedge, wakes her, and tells her that
he has seen a dead man in her father’s garden.
She asks about the dead man’s hawk, hound,
sword. His hawk and hound were gone, his
horse was tied to a tree, a bloody sword lay
under his head. She asks about his clothes,
and receives a description, with the addition
that his hair was bonny and new combed.
‘I combed it late yesterday!’ says the lady.
‘Who now will shoe my foot, and glove my
hand, and father my bairn?’ The knight
offers himself for all these, but the lady will
commit herself only to Heaven. The knight,
after knacking his fingers quite superfluously,
unmasks; he has only been making a trial of
her truth.</p>

<p class='c011'>A large part of this piece is imitated or
taken outright from very well known ballads
(as has already been pointed out by the editor
of the Ballad Minstrelsy of Scotland, 1871,
p. 345): 5–8 from ‘Young Johnstone,’ No 88;
10, 11 from ‘The Lass of Roch Royal,’ No 76
(see particularly <b>E</b> 1–4, and compare No 66,
<b>A</b> 24, etc.); for 13<sup>1,2</sup> see No 91, <b>B</b> 5<sup>1</sup>, 6<sup>1</sup>, 7<sup>1</sup>,
<b>D</b> 7<sup>1,2</sup>, No 257, <b>A</b> 7.</p>

<p class='c011'>Grundtvig notes that this piece is of the
same description as the Danish ‘Troskabspröven,’
Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, IV, 553,
No 252, one version of which is translated by
Prior, III, 289, No 146. Naturally, the fidelity
of maid or wife is celebrated in the ballads
of every tongue and people. This particular
ballad, so far as it is original, is of very
ordinary quality. The ninth stanza is pretty,
but not quite artless.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>A young lord, Willie, asks his ‘gay lady’
whose the child is that she is going with. She
owns that a priest is the father, which does
not appear to disconcert Willie. A boy is
born, and the mother charges Willie to throw
him into the sea, ‘never to return till white
fish he bring hame.’ Willie takes the boy
(now called his son) to his mother, and tells
her that his ‘bride’ is a king’s daughter;
upon which his mother, who had had an ill
opinion of the lady, promises to do as well by
Willie’s son as she had done by Willie. Returning
to his wife, he finds her weeping and
repining for the ‘white fisher’ that she had
‘sent to the sea.’ Willie offers her a cordial;
she says that the man who could have
drowned her son would be capable of poisoning
her. Willie then tells her that his mother
has the boy in charge; she is consoled, and
declares that if he had not been the father
she should not have been the mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>To make this story hang together at all, we
must suppose that the third and fourth stanzas
are tropical, and that Willie was the
priest; or else that they are sarcastic, and are
uttered in bitter resentment of Willie’s suspicion,
or affected suspicion. But we need
not trouble ourselves much to make these counterfeits
reasonable. Those who utter them
rely confidently upon our taking folly and
jargon as the marks of genuineness. The
white fisher is a trumpery fancy; 2, 7, 8, 12
are frippery commonplaces.</p>

  <h2 id='c265' class='c009'>265<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>THE KNIGHT’S GHOST</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>‘The Knight’s Ghost,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 227.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A lady who is expecting the return of her
lord from sea goes down to the strand to meet
him. The ship comes in, but the sailors tell
her that she will never see her husband; he
has been slain. She invites the men to drink
with her, takes them down to the cellar, makes
them drunk, locks the door, and bids them lie
there for the bad news they have told; then
she throws the keys into the sea, to lie there
till her lord returns. After these efforts she
falls asleep in her own room, and her dead
lord starts up at her feet; he brings the keys
with him, and charges her to release his men,
who had done their best for him and were
not to blame for his death. The lady, to turn
this visit to the more account, asks to be informed
what day she is to die, and what day
to be buried. The knight is not empowered
to answer, but, come to heaven when she will,
he will be her porter. He sees no objection
to telling her that she will be married again
and have nine children, six ladies free and
three bold young men.</p>

<p class='c011'>The piece has not a perceptible globule of
old blood in it, yet it has had the distinction
of being more than once translated as a specimen
of Scottish popular ballads. ‘Monie’ in
2<sup>2</sup> may be plausibly read, or understood, ‘menie,’
retinue; still the antecedent presumption
in favor of nonsense in ballads of this
class makes one hesitate. 7<sup>3,4</sup> is unnatural;
no dissembling would be required to induce
the young men to drink. In 8<sup>3</sup>, ‘birled them
wi the beer’ is what we should expect, not
‘birled wi them.’</p>

<p class='c011'>27 f. Professor Bugge, Arkiv för nordisk Filologi,
VII, 120–36, 1891, points out that a Swedish ballad
given in Grundtvig, D. g. F. IV, 813 f., <b>F</b>, and here referred
to under ‘Hind Etin,’ I, 364 b, as Swedish <b>C</b>,
has resemblances with ‘Kvindemorderen.’ Fru Malin
is combing her hair <i>al fresco</i>, when a suitor enters her
premises; he remarks that a crown would sit well on
her head. The lady skips off to her chamber, and exclaims,
Christ grant he may wish to be mine! The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>suitor follows her, and asks, Where is the fair dame who
wishes to be mine? But when Fru Malin comes to table
she is in trouble, and the suitor puts her several leading
questions. She is sad, not for any of several reasons
suggested, but for the bridge under which her seven
sisters (syskon) lie. ‘Sorrow not,’ he says, ‘we shall
build the bridge so broad and long that four-and-twenty
horses may go over at a time.’ They pass through a
wood; on the bridge her horse stumbles, and she is
thrown into the water. She cries for help; she will give
him her gold crown. He cares nothing for the crown,
and never will help her out. Bugge maintains that this
ballad is not, as Grundtvig considered it, a compound of
‘Nökkens Svig’ and ‘Harpens Kraft,’ but an independent
ballad, ‘The Bride Drowned,’ of a set to which
belong ‘Der Wasserman,’ Haupt and Schmaler, I, 62,
No 34, and many German ballads: see Grundtvig, IV,
810 f, and here I, 365 f., 38.</p>

<p class='c011'>39 ff. The Polish ballad ‘Jás i Kasia.’ Mr John
Karłowicz has given, in Wisła, IV, 393–424, the results
of a study of this ballad, and they are here briefly summarized.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ten unprinted versions are there added to the large
number already published, making about ninety copies,
if fragments are counted. Copies not noted at I, 39,
486, are, besides these ten, the following. Kolberg,
Krakowskie, II, 111, 168, Nos 208, 336; Kieleckie, II,
148, No 453; Leęczychie, p. 131, No 223; Lubelskie, I,
289 ff., Nos 473, 474; Pozna[‘n]skie, IV, 63, No 131;

p. 88, No 66. Wasilewski, Jagodne, etc., No 120.
Federowski, Lud okolic Żarek, etc., p. 102, No 49.</p>

<p class='c011'>Most of the ten versions printed in Wisła agree with
others previously published; in some there are novel
details. In No 3, p. 398, Kasia, thrown into the water
by her lover, is rescued by her brother. In No 10,
p. 404, Jás, when drowning the girl, tells her that he
has drowned four already, and she shall be the fifth;
her brother comes sliding down a silken rope; fishermen
take the girl out dead. There are still only two
of all the Polish versions in which Catharine kills John,
<b>A a</b>, <b>b</b>. The name Ligar, in the latter, points clearly,
Mr Karłowicz remarks, to the U-linger, Ad-elger, Ol-legehr
of the German versions, and he is convinced
that the ballad came into Poland from Germany, although
the girl is not drowned in the German ballad,
as in the Polish, English, and French.</p>

<p class='c011'>John, who is commonly the hero in the Polish ballad,
is at the beginning of many copies declared to have
sung, and the words have no apparent sense. But we
observe that in the versions of western Europe the
hero plays on the horn, sings a seductive song, promises
to teach the girl to sing, etc.; the unmeaning Polish
phrase is therefore a survival.</p>

<p class='c011'>In many of the German versions a bird warns the
maid of her danger. This feature is found once only
in Polish: in Zawili[‘n]ski (No 69 A of Karłowicz).</p>

<p class='c011'>At p. 777 of Sušil’s Moravian Songs there are two
other versions which I have not noticed, the second of
them manifestly derived from Poland.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a Little-Russian ballad which begins like
the Polish ‘Jás i Kasia,’ but ends with the girl being
tied to a tree and burned, instead of being drowned:
Wisła, IV, 423, from Zbiór wiadom. do antrop., III,
150, No 17. Traces of the incident of the burning are
also found in Polish and Moravian songs: Wisła, pp.
418–22. It is probable that there were two independent
ballads, and that these have been confounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>42 a, III, 497 a. <b>A</b>. Add: ‘Renaud et ses Femmes,’
Revue des Traditions Populaires, VI, 34.</p>

<p class='c011'>43 a. ‘Lou Cros dé Proucinello,’ Daymard, Vieux
Chants p. recueillis en Quercy, p. 130, has at the end
two traits of this ballad. A young man carries off a girl
whom he has been in love with seven years; he throws
her into a ravine; as she falls, she catches at a tree;
he cuts it away; she cries, What shall I do with my
pretty gowns? and is answered, Give them to me for
another mistress. Cf. also Daymard, p. 128.</p>

<p class='c011'>The copy of ‘May Collin’ which follows is quite the
best of the series <b>C-G</b>. It is written on the same sheet
of paper as the “copy of some antiquity” used by
Scott in making up his ‘Gay Goss Hawk’ (ed. 1802,
II, 7). The sheet is perhaps as old as any in the volume
in which it occurs, but may possibly not be the
original. ‘May Collin’ is not in the same hand as the
other ballad.</p>

<p class='c011'>According to the preface to a stall-copy spoken of by
Motherwell, Minstrelsy, p. lxx, 24, “the treacherous
and murder-minting lover was an ecclesiastic of the
monastery of Maybole,” and the preface to <b>D d</b> (see
I, 488) makes him a Dominican friar. So, if we were
to accept these guides, the ‘Sir’ would be the old ecclesiastical
title and equivalent to the ‘Mess’ of the
copy now to be given.</p>

garnish and filling out) <b>A</b> was compounded were:
<b>a</b>. “Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,”
No 20, obtained from Nelly Laidlaw, and in the handwriting

the same collection, No 11, in the handwriting of

<p class='c011'>Bulgarian ballad.—Stojan is married on Sunday;
on Monday he is ordered to join the army. His wife
gives him a posy, which will remain fresh until she
marries another man. He serves nine years; the tenth
the queen discovers from his talk that he has a wife, and
gives him permission to go home. He arrives the very
day on which his wife is to be remarried, goes to the
wedding, and asks her to kiss his hand and accept a
gift from him. She recognizes him by the ring on his
hand, sends off the guests, and goes home with him.
Collection of the Ministry of Instruction, I, 39. In a
variant, Verković, p. 329, No 301, the man is gone three
years, and arrives just as the wedding procession comes
for the bride. (W. W.)</p>

How Fraud made entrance into Russia. Ivan the Terrible
demands tribute of neighboring princes. They
propose to him three riddles: if he guesses them, they
are to pay twelve casks of gold and tribute; if he fails,
they take his kingdom. A marvellous old man helps
the Tsar out. He has been promised a cask of gold,
but the Tsar fills one of the casks two thirds with sand,
and offers that. The old man tells him that he, the
Tsar, has brought Fraud into the land, never to be eradicated.
Ivan begs him to take one of the other casks,
but in vain. The old man vanishes; it was God. Rybnikof,

Lundarasena is on a voyage, a great hurricane arises.
An offering of jewels is made to the sea, but does not
quiet it. Lundarasena says: “It is through my demerits
in former births that this day of doom has suddenly
come upon you.” He flings himself into the
water; the wind falls immediately and the sea becomes
calm. (He is not drowned.) Kathá Sarit Ságara,

that ‘King Estmere’ resembles in a general
way a series of German poems of adventure, in which
a young king (or his guardians) is nice about a wife,

by Herd, and probably Lochroyan was intended in I,

indistinctly written, and may be read <i>e</i>. <b>B</b> came to

121, No 176.</p>

<p class='c011'>236 f., III, 512 f. The Rev. S. Baring-Gould has
recovered several copies of ‘The Unquiet Grave’ in
the West Country. It will be observed that the variations
in this ballad do not take a wide range. The
verses are not always sung in the same order; there is
not story enough to keep them in place. Mr Baring-Gould
informs me that there is a Devon popular tale
which is very similar (possibly a prose version of the
ballad). In this, a bramble-leaf comes between the
lips of the maiden and her dead lover, and her life is
saved thereby. This tale is utilized in the ballad as
printed in Songs of the West, No 6, ‘Cold blows the
wind, sweetheart!’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Charles Graeme,’ Buchan’s Ballads of the North of
Scotland, I, 89, Motherwell’s MS., p. 624, begins with stanzas
which belong to this ballad. What follows after the third,
or just possibly the sixth, stanza reads as if some contributor
had been diverting himself with an imposition on the
editor’s simplicity. Buchan himself remarks in a note, p.
299: “There seems to be a very great inconsistency manifested
throughout the whole of this ballad in the lady’s behavior
towards the ghost of her departed lover. Perhaps
she wished to sit and sigh alone, undisturbed with visits
from the inhabitants of the grave.” (Translated by Gerhard,
p. 63.)</p>

<p class='c038'>P. 240, 513 a, III, 514. Mabillon cites Balderic’s
history of the first crusade, whose words are: “Multi
etiam de gente plebeia crucem sibi divinitus innatam
jactando ostentabant, quod et idem quædam ex mulierculis
præsumpserunt; hoc enim falsum deprehensum
est omnino. Multi vero ferrum callidum instar
crucis sibi adhibuerunt, vel peste jactantiæ, vel bonæ
suæ voluntatis ostentatione.” Migne, Patrologiæ Curs.

<p class='c011'>A man who is looking forward to a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land wishes to have the cross burned into his
right shoulder, since then, though he should be stript
of his clothes, the cross would remain: Miracula S.
Thomæ, Auctore Benedicto, Robertson, Materials for
the History of Thomas Becket, II, 175. The branding
of the cross in the flesh must have become common,
since it was forbidden by the canon law. In some editions
of the Sarum Missal, a warning is inserted in the
Servitium Peregrinorum: “Combustio crucis in carne
peregrinis euntibus Hierusalem prohibitum est in lege,
secundum jura canonica, sub pœna excommunicationis
majoris.” Sarum Missal, Burntisland, 1867, col. 856*.

<p class='c011'>The following copy was kindly communicated to me
by Mr David MacRitchie, Honorary Secretary of the
Gypsy Lore Society, in advance of its publication in
the Journal of the society. While it preserves the
framework of the story, it differs very considerably in
details from all the printed copies. It is evidently of
the same origin as some of the Scottish versions (all
of which seem to derive from print), though it has no
marked resemblance to the actual form of any particular
one of these. Some peculiarities are plausibly
attributable to dim or imperfect recollection. Thus,
the ball-play of <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, etc., is turned into a ball. Lord
Barnard is made a king, and the page the king’s brother
(neither of which changes is an improvement). We
may observe that in <b>J</b> Lord Barnabas is at the king’s
court, and in <b>I</b> Sir Grove is Lord Bengwill’s brother;
but these points are not decisive, and the changes may
be purely arbitrary. 4 shows traces of <b>E</b> 5 and <b>F</b> 3;
8 may have been suggested by something like <b>G</b> 4;
and the last line of 14 looks like a corruption of <b>G</b> 29.
This involves the supposition that the source of the
ballad was a version somewhat different from any hitherto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>recovered; but ‘Little Musgrave’ is one of the
best known of all ballads, and the variants must have
been innumerable. On the whole, 1–8, 14, present a
free treatment of ill-remembered matter; 9–13 are fairly
well preserved; compare <b>E</b> 13–17.</p>

<p class='c011'>Julius Krohn has lately made an important contribution
to our knowledge of this ballad in an article in
Virittäjä, II, 36–50, translated into German under the
title ‘Das Lied vom Mädchen welches erlöst werden
soll,’ Helsingfors, 1891. Professor Estlander had previously
discussed the ballad in Finsk Tidskrift, X, 1881
(which I have not yet seen), and had sought to show
that it was of Finnish origin, a view which Krohn
disputes and refutes. There are nearly fifty Finnish
versions. The curse with which <b>I</b> ends, and which is
noted as occurring in Swedish <b>C</b> (compare also the
Sicilian ballad), is never wanting in the Finnish, and
is found also in the Esthonian copies.</p>

<p class='c011'>M. Doucieux has attempted a reconstruction of the
text in Mélusine, V, 265 ff. He cites M. Gaston Paris
as having lately pointed out a striking similitude between
the first half of the French popular ballad and
that of a little romance of Bele Ydoine composed in the
twelfth century by Audefrois le Bastars (Bartsch, Altfranzösische
Romanzen und Pastourellen, p. 59, No 57).
This resemblance has, I suppose, occasioned the title of
‘Belle Idoine’ to be given editorially to No 20 above,
for the name does not occur in the ballad.</p>

<h4 class='c037'>110. The Knight and the Shepherd’s</h4>
<p class='c038'>Daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>P. 457 a, 476 f. <b>A. b</b> is printed in the Ballad Society’s
ed. of the Roxburghe Ballads, III, 449. It is in the
Crawford collection, No 1142. There are four copies
in the Douce collection: I, 11 b, 14, 21 b, IV, 33, two of
Charles II.’s time, two of no account (Chappell).</p>

<p class='c011'>458 b. The Danish ballad is now No 314 of Danmarks
gamle Folkeviser, continued by Axel Olrik, V,
II, 377, ‘Ebbe Galt—Hr. Tidemand.’ There are four
Danish versions, <b>A-D</b>, some of the sixteenth century;
a Färöe version in five copies, ‘Ebbin kall,’ Føroyjakvæði,
as elaborated by Grundtvig and Bloch, No 123,
D. g. F., <b>E</b>; an Icelandic version, ‘Símonar kvæði,’
Íslenzk Fornkvæði, I, 224, No 26. Danish <b>C</b>, Vedel,
III, No 17, is compounded of <b>B</b> and a lost version which
must have resembled <b>A</b>. The copy in Danske Viser,
Abrahamson, No 63, is recompounded from C and one
of the varieties of <b>D</b>. Herr Tidemand is the offending
knight in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; Ebbe Galt in <b>B</b>, <b>D</b> and the Färöe
<b>E</b>; Kóng Símon in the Icelandic version. <b>A</b> has fifteen
stanzas, <b>B</b> only eleven; the story is extended to
sixty-seven in <b>D</b>. A begins directly with a complaint
on the part of the injured husband before the King’s
Bench; the husband in this version is of a higher class
than in the others,—Herr Peder, and not a peasant.
The forcing is done at the woman’s house in A and the
Icelandic version; in <b>B-E</b> in a wood. In all, the ravisher
is capitally punished.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hr. Olrik is disposed to think ‘The Knight and the
Shepherd’s Daughter’ a not very happy patching together
of ‘Ebbe Galt,’ a lost ballad, and ‘Tærning-spillet,’
D. g. F., No 248, by a minstrel who may perhaps
have had Chaucer’s story in mind. I am not prepared
to go further than to admit that there is a gross inconsistency,
even absurdity, in the English ballad; the
shepherd’s daughter of the beginning could not possibly
turn out a duke’s, an earl’s, or a king’s daughter in the
conclusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Malfred og Sallemand,’ p. 458, note §, which has
many verses in common with ‘Ebbe Galt,’ is now No
313 of Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, V, II, 367.</p>

<h4 class='c037'>114. Johnie Cock.</h4>

<p class='c038'>P. 1. There is a ballad of ‘Bertram, the Bauld
Archer’ in Pitcairn’s MSS, III, 51; printed in Maidment’s
Scotish Ballads and Songs, 1859, p. 46. Pitcairn
derived it from Mrs McCorquodale, Stirling, a
farmer’s wife, who remembered it “to have been sung by
her grandmother, a woman above eighty years old, who
stated that she had it from an old woman, her aunt.”
The reciter herself was above sixty-five, and had “first
heard it when a little girl.” Nevertheless, Bertram is
fustian, of a sort all too familiar in the last century.
The story, excepting perhaps the first stanza, is put into
the mouth of Bertram’s mistress, <i>à la</i> Gilderoy. The
bauld archer has gone to the forest for to mak a robberie.
The king has made proclamation that he will
give five hunder merk for Bertram’s life. John o
Shoumacnair (Stronmaknair, Maidment) proposes to
his billies to kill Bertram and get the money. They
busk themselves in hodden gray, ‘like to friers o low
degree,’ present themselves to Bertram and ask a
boon of him, which Bertram grants without inquiry.
While they are parleying, Shoumacnair drives his dirk
into Bertram’s back. But, though he swirls wi the
straik, Bertram draws his awsome bran, kills ane,
wounds twa, and then his stalwart, gallant soul takes its
flight to heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'>2b. Braid. “This version [‘Johnie of Braidisbank,’
I] was taken down by Motherwell and me from the
recitation of Mr James Knox, land-surveyor at Tipperlinne,
near Edinburgh, in the month of May, 1824, when
we met him in the good town of Paisley. At 17 a tradition
is mentioned which assigns Braid to have been the
scene of this woeful hunting. Mr Knox is the authority
for this tradition. Braid is in the neighborhood
of Tipperlinne.” Note by Mr P. A. Ramsay in a copy
of the Minstrelsy which had belonged to Motherwell.

<p class='c011'>Wolves in Scotland. “It is usually said that the
species was extirpated about 1680 by Sir Ewen Cameron
of Lochiel, but the tradition to that effect appears
to be true only of Sir Ewen’s own district of western
Invernessshire.” The <i>very</i> last wolf may have been
killed in 1743. R. Chambers, Domestic Annals of Scotland,
III, 690.</p>

21, 1381). See Historical MSS Commission,
Fifth Report, Appendix, p. 511, col. 2. The pronunciation,
Robinhood (p. 41 a, note †), is clearly seen
in the jingle quoted by Nash, Strange Newes, 1593,

neighbourhood, Dead and buried art thou with Robinhood.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the disbursements of John Lord Howard,

Thomas Earl of Surrey, temp. 1481–1490, ed. by J. P.
Collier, 1844, Roxburghe Club, p. 464. Collier, p.

bought them of a person of the name of Robin Hood
is singular.”</p>

Nottingham, III, 64, 230, 254. A Robynhode Well

<h4 class='c037'>121. Robin Hood and the Potter.</h4>

<p class='c038'>P. 108 a. Compare the Great-Russian bylinas about
Il’ja of Murom and his son (daughter). Il’ja is captain
of the march-keepers, Dobrynja second in command.
No man, on foot or on horse, no bird or beast,
undertakes to pass. But one day a young hero crosses,
neither greeting nor paying toll. One of the guards,
commonly Dobrynja, is sent after him, but comes back
in a fright. Il’ja takes the matter in hand, has a fight
with the young man, is worsted at first, but afterwards
gets the better of him. Wollner, Volksepik der Grossrussen,

<h4 class='c037'>141. Robin Hood rescuing Will Stutly.</h4>

<p class='c038'>P. 186. Stanzas 19, 20. The boon of being allowed
to fight at odds, rather than be judicially executed, is
of very common occurrence in South-Slavic songs, generally
with the nuance that the hero asks to have the
worst horse and the worst weapon. A well-known instance
is the Servian song of Jurišić Janko, Karadžić,
II, 319, No 52, and the older Croat song of
Svilojević (treating the same matter), Bogišić, p. 120

<h4 class='c037'>158. Hugh Spencer’s Feats in France.</h4>

<p class='c038'>III, 276, note †. I had remarked that this ballad
was after the fashion of Russian bylinas. Professor
Wollner indicates especially the bylina of Dobrynja
and Vasilij Kazimirović, which in a general way is
singularly like ‘Hugh Spencer.’ In this very fine ballad,
Vladimir is in arrears with his tribute to a Saracen
king, and appoints Vasilij his envoy, to make payment.
Vasilij asks that he may have Dobrynja go with
him, and Dobrynja asks for Ivanuka’s company.
(Compare <b>B</b>.) Dobrynja beats the king at chess and
at the bow (which corresponds to the justing in the
English ballad); then follows a great fight, the result
of which is that the Saracen king is fain to pay tribute
himself. Wollner, Volksepik der Grossrussen, pp. 123–125.</p>

In his note, II, 220, to the poem ‘Against the Scottes,’
Dyce remarks that St George is called Our Lady’s
Knight “in a song written about the same time as the
present poem, Cott. MS. Domit. A. xviii. fol. 248.” This
appears to be the song quoted from the same MS. by

<p class='c011'>For his later edition of ‘The Battle of Otterburn,’
Scott says he used “two copies&nbsp;... obtained from
the recitation of old persons residing at the head of
Ettrick Forest.” James Hogg sent Scott, in a letter
dated September 10 (1802?), twenty-nine stanzas “collected
from two different people, a crazy old man and
a woman deranged in her mind,” and subsequently recovered,
by “pumping” his “old friends’ memory,”
other lines and half lines out of which (using the necessary
cement, and not a little) he built up eleven stanzas
more, and these he seems to have forwarded in the same
letter. These two communications are what is described
by Scott as two copies. They will be combined here
according to Hogg’s directions, and the second set of
verses bracketed for distinction.</p>

<p class='c011'>The materials out of which <b>C</b> was constructed can
now easily be separated. We must bear in mind that
Scott allowed himself a liberty of alteration; this he
did not, however, carry very far in the present instance.
1–13, 15–19, 23 are taken, with slight change or none,
from Hogg’s first “copy” of verses; 24, 26–29 from the
second; 30–35 are repeated from Scott’s first edition.
14 is altered from <b>A</b> 16; 20=Hogg 21<sup>1,2</sup> + Scott;
21=Hogg 22<sup>1</sup> + Hogg 35<sup>2–4</sup>; 22=Hogg 23<sup>1,3</sup> + Scott;
25=Hogg 28<sup>1</sup> + <b>B</b> 8<sup>2–4</sup>. Scott did well to drop Hogg 9,
and ought to have dropped Hogg 8.</p>

enamourd. These I have been obliged to arrange
somewhat myself, as you will see below; but so mixed
are they with original lines and sentences that I think,
if you pleased, they might pass without any acknowledgment.

<p class='c011'>‘The Sonnge of Sir Andraye Barton, Knight,’ English
Miscellanies, edited by James Raine, Surtees Society,
vol. lxxxv, p. 64, 1890; from a MS. in a hand of
the sixteenth century now in York Minster Library.</p>

<p class='c011'>This very interesting version of Sir Andrew Barton,
the editor informs us, was originally No 25 of a ballad-book
in small quarto. It came recently “into the possession
of the Dean and Chapter of York with a number
of papers which belonged in the seventeenth century
to the episcopal families of Lamplugh and Davenant.”
If, as is altogether probable, there were copies of other
ballads in the same book in quality as good as this,
and if, as is equally probable, no more of the book can
be recovered, our only comfort is the cold one of having
had losses. In several details this copy differs from
that of the Percy MS., but not more than would be expected.
The English sail out of the Thames on the
morrow after midsummer month, July 1, and come back
the night before St Maudlen’s eve, or the night of July
20, stanzas 17, 74. In stanza 42 Barton boasts that
he had once sent thirty Portingail heads home salted—
‘to eat with bread’! We read in Lesley’s History
that the Hollanders had taken and spoiled divers Scots
ships, and had cruelly murdered and cast overboard the
merchants and passengers; in revenge for which Andrew
Barton took many ships of that country, and filled
certain pipes with the heads of the Hollanders and sent
them to the Scottish king. (Ed. 1830, p. 74; ed. 1578,
p. 329.) The eating is a ferocious addition of the ballad.
Several passages of this copy are corrupted. A throws
light upon some of these places, but others remain to
me unamendable.</p>

of the Minstrelsy, 1803, II, 163. (Read in 1<sup>2</sup>, on

furnished by Sharpe, which was not <b>A a</b>, and has not
so far been recovered. Besides this, “copies from various
quarters” were resorted to. (Half a dozen stanzas
are found in <b>G</b>, but <b>G</b> itself is very likely a compilation).
Eight copies from Abbotsford are now printed
for the first time. Two of these may have been in
Scott’s hands in time to be used, two were certainly
not, and for the others we have no date.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is only one novel feature in all these copies:
in <b>U</b> 13 Mary’s paramour is a pottinger. The remark
that there is no trace of an admixture of the Russian
story with that of the apothecary, page 383, must therefore
be withdrawn.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c017'><sup>[151]</sup></a> Mary in this version, as in <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,

<p class='c038'>Finlay sent Scott, March 27, 1803, the following copy
of ‘The Queen’s Marie,’ as he “had written it down
from memory:” Letters addressed to Sir Walter Scott,
I, No 87, Abbotsford. Stanzas 10, 9, 12 appear in the
second volume of the Minstrelsy, 1802, p. 154, with the
variation of a couple of words, as ‘The Lament of the
Queen’s Marie’ (here <b>I b</b>). Perhaps Finlay adopted
these three stanzas into his copy. Stanzas 1, 3, 6, 8,
with very slight variations, were printed by Finlay in
the preface to his Scottish Ballads, 1808 (<b>O</b>).</p>

<h4 class='c037'>190. Jamie Telfer of the Fair Dodhead.</h4>

<p class='c038'>P. 4 a. James Hogg, writing to Scott, June 30,
[1802?] says: “I am surprised to find that the songs
in your collection differ so widely from my mother’s....
‘Jamie Telfer’ differs in many particulars.” (Letters,
I, No. 44.) Scott’s remarks should have been cited
from the edition of 1802, I, 91.</p>

<p class='c011'>5. Mr Andrew Lang has obligingly called my attention
to difficulties which attend the assumption that the
Dodhead of the ballad is the place of that name in Selkirkshire.
Jamie Telfer, st. 7, runs ten miles between
Dodhead and Stobs, and this is far enough if help is to
be timely; but he would have to run thirty if his Dodhead
were in Selkirkshire. With succor not nearer
than that, Telfer would soon have been harried out of
existence. The distances are too great both for the
English and the Scots. But there is a Dod south of the
Teviot, not far from Skelfhill, which is some seven
miles only from Stobs. (Dodhead is not entered here
on the Ordnance map, “but Dodburn is just under Dodrig,
and where there is a Dodburn there is ‘tied’ to
be a Dodhead in this country.”) Turning from Stobs
to Teviot, Telfer would come in due order to Coltherdscleugh,
Branxholm, and Borthwick Water, without the
loss of time which he would, on the other supposition,
incur in passing and returning. (See a note, by Mr
Lang, in Mrs G. R. Tomson’s Ballads of the North
Countrie, 1888, p. 435.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Several other matters are not quite clear. Catslockhill,
for instance, seems to be misplaced. Mr Lang, a
native of Ettrick valley, knows of no Catslack but that
in Yarrow. Of this, Mr T. Craig-Brown (Selkirkshire,
I, 21), who accepts Scott’s Dodhead, says, “A long
ride, if Catslack is in Yarrow.”</p>

the country-people still point out a stone where
the unshriven soul of Parcy used to frequent

stating his authority) there was “a line of nine barons,
all of whom, in the unruly times in which they lived,
died violent deaths.” The ballad may have commenced

lost. “The whole incident surely implies a very early and
primitive system of manners, not to speak of the circumstance
of the court being held at Carlisle, which never
was the case in any late period of English history.” (Chambers’s
Scottish Ballads, p. 306.) “In our version [<b>E</b>] the
scene of the theft is laid at London, but Carlisle, we are inclined
to think, is the true reading. The great distance
between Scotland and London, and the nature of the roads
in times of old, would render the event an improbable, if
not altogether an impossible, one to have occurred; and we
can easily imagine, when the court was at Carlisle, that
such a good practical joke was planned and carried into
execution by some waggish courtiers.” (Dixon, p. 93 f.)</p>

Frendraught is generally represented to have been utterly
ruined in his estate, but that is probably an exaggeration.
His sufferings are thus depicted in the Charges against the
Marquis of Huntly and others anent the disorders in the
North (Spalding, I, 420): “Forasmuch as the Lords of Secret
Council are informed that great numbers of sorners and
broken men of the clan Gregor, clan Lachlan (etc.), as also
divers of the name of Gordon&nbsp;... have this long time, and
now lately very grievously, infested his Majesty’s loyal subjects
in the north parts, especially the laird of Frendraught
and his tenants, by frequent slaughters, herships, and barbarous
cruelties committed upon them, and by a late treasonable
fireraising within the said laird of Frendraught his
bounds, whereby not only is all the gentleman’s lands laid
waste, his whole goods and bestial spoiled, slain and maigled,
some of his servants killed and cruelly demeaned, but
also the whole tenants of his lands and domestics of his
house have left his service, and himself, with the hazard of
his life, has been forced to steal away under night and have
his refuge to his Majesty’s Council, etc.” It was reported
that Frendraught obtained a decree against the marquis for
200,000 merks (Scots) for scathe, and another for 100,000
pounds (or merks) for spoliation of tithes, but that he recovered
the money does not appear. (Spalding, I, 71, 115.)
In 1636, through the exertions of Sir Robert Gordon, Huntly
and Frendraught were brought to submit all differences on
either side, “and particularly a great action of law prosecuted
by Frendraught against the marquis,” to the arbitrament
of friends. Huntly died before a decision was reached,
but “the Laird of Frendraught retired himself home to his
own lands, and there lived peaceably.” (Genealogical History
of Sutherland, p. 479.)</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. So John Gordon, Viscount Melgum, the second son of
the Marquis of Huntly, was indifferently called, though the
title of Viscount Aboyne belonged to his elder brother,
George, and was not conferred upon <i>him</i> until after John’s
death. Sir Robert Gordon says that the Marquis of Huntly
“ordained” for Melgum the lands of Aboyne, and others.
Melgum was married to Sophia Hay, daughter of the Earl
of Errol, as appears also in the ballad.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. What manner of helping Frendraught could have given
Spalding does not “condescend upon.” The way down
stairs was barred by fire, the windows were barred with
iron. [“But the stairs or monty being in fire, and the windows
grated with strong bars of iron, there was no moyen
to escape:” Blakhal’s Narration, Spalding Club, p. 125.]
Ladders and crowbars occur to us, but a tower with walls
ten feet thick was not expected to burn, the servants had
not been drilled in managing fires, people smoked from their
beds at two in the morning are not apt to have their wits
about them, and the combustion was rapid.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. All the documents will be found in the Appendix to
Spalding. Dr John Hill Burton, in Narratives from Criminal
Trials in Scotland, 1852, I, 202 ff, leans hard against
Frendraught. “With pretty abundant materials, it is impossible,
even at the present day, entirely to clear up the
mystery, but we can see by what machinations inquiry was
baffled.” “It will be seen that no evidence against him was
received, that it was considered an offence to accuse him.”
“Frendraught, though he had with a high hand averted even
the pretence of inquiry on the part of the government, did
not go unpunished, <i>whether he was guilty or not</i>.” Dr Burton
speaks with more reserve in his History of Scotland, VI,
209; little more is insisted on than a wish of the Court to
foster the Crichtons as a balance to the power of the house
of Huntly. It is clear that Frendraught had all the consideration
and help from the government which he could claim.
Mr Charles Rampini, who has discussed the affair in The
Scottish Review, X, 143 ff., 1887, concludes favorably to
Frendraught’s innocence of the fire.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. “Many years ago, when the well was cleared out, this
tradition was corroborated by their finding the keys: at
least, such was the report of the country.” (Finlay, I, xxi,
citing a correspondent.) Of course we should have had to
believe everything against Lady Frendraught, even that
she had been so simple as to throw them in, if keys had been
found in the well; but the land-steward of the proprietor of
the estate informed the late Mr Norval Clyne that the draw-well
was searched, and no keys were found.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. This is, of course, the style of the kirk. The fifty-third
psalm of the Vulgate would not have been out of place for
Lord John, who was a Catholic; but no doubt Lord John is
taken for a Presbyterian in the ballad, and the ‘three’ is for
rhyme. Father Blakhal maintains that Frendraught burnt
his tower, not to rid himself of Rothiemay, but out of theological
malice to Melgum “for his zeal in defending and
protecting the poor Catholics against the tyranny of our
puritanical bishops and ministers.” “As he [Melgum] was
dying for the defence of the poor Catholics, God did bestow
upon him the grace to augment the number at the last hour
of his life, persuading the Baron of Rothiemay to abjure the
heresy of Calvin, and make the profession of the Catholic
faith openly, to the hearing of the traitor and all who were
with him in the court. They two being at a window, and
whilst their legs were burning, they did sing together <i>Te
Deum</i>; which ended, they did tell at the window that
their legs being consumed even to their knees, etc.... And
so this noble martyr finished this mortal life, at the
age of four and twenty years.” A Brief Narration, etc., p.
124 f.</p>

<p class='c011'>Blakhal, who is far from being a cautious writer, also tells
us that “the traitor,” Frendraught, “with his men,in arms,
walked all the night in the court,” to kill Gordon and
Rothiemay, if they should escape from the fire. There is a
passage of the same purport in one of Arthur Johnston’s
two poems on the burning of Frendraught, “Querela
Sophiæ Hayæ,” etc.:</p>

account given by Chambers we are told that the
house belonging to the family at Maybole was fitted for the
countess’s reception “by the addition of a fine projecting
stair-case, upon which were carved heads representing those
of her lover and his band.... The effigies of the gypsies
are very minute, being subservient to the decoration of a fine
triple window at the top of the stair-case, and stuck upon
the tops and bottoms of a series of little pilasters which
adorn that part of the building. The head of Johnie Faa
himself is distinct from the rest, larger, and more lachrymose
in the expression of the features. <i>Some windows in
the upper flat of Cassilis Castle are similarly adorned; but
regarding them tradition is silent.</i>”</p>

from these letters that the countess was a sober and religious
woman. Some minor difficulties which attend the supposition
of this lady’s absconding with Johnny Faa, or any
gypsy, are barely worth mentioning. At the time when
Johnny Faa was put down, in 1624, the countess was seventeen
years old, and yet she is made the mother of two children.
If we shift the elopement to the other end of her life,
there was then (so severe had been the measures taken with
these limmers) perhaps not a gypsy left in Scotland. See

out and builded huts for themselves in different places around
the town, particularly in the South Inch [etc.] and the
grounds near the river Almond, at the mouth thereof, in all
which places there are as yet the remains of their huts
which they lodged in.” So, when this same pestilence was

they were infected immediately to repair into them:” Porteous,

<p class='c011'>What should prompt Lawrie to malice against the
marchioness is unknown. Kinloch, Ancient Scottish Ballads,
p. 58, accepting the story of the old woman from
whom he obtained <b>E</b>, says: “The Laird of Blackwood and
the Marquis of —— were rivals in the affection of a lovely
and amiable young lady, who, preferring the latter, became
his wife. Blackwood&nbsp;... vowed revenge,” etc. Chambers,
who repeats this account, Scottish Ballads, p. 150, remarks
that Lawrie seems to have been considerably advanced
in life at the time. Lawrie’s son made a “retour of services”
in 1650, and may be supposed then to have been of age.
The Marquis of Douglas was in his twenty-fourth year
when he married, in 1670, and probably Lady Barbara
Erskine was not older. Maidment is surprised that Lawrie,
“a man of uncertain lineage,” should have succeeded with
the widow Marion Weir. What is to be thought of his
aspiring, at the age of sixty, or more, to “the affection of a
lovely and amiable young lady” of the family of Mar, one
of the most ancient in Scotland?</p>

who, in the preceding February, was a corporal in the

mentions “the loss of Cornet Robert Graham” at Drumclog.
Russell speaks of a Graham killed at Drumclog, and,
like Creichton, tells a story of the disfigurement of his face
(which he attributes to the cornet’s own dog). Lawrie of
Blackwood, Lord Jamie Douglas’s Jago, was indicted and
tried, Nov. 24, 1682–Feb. 7. 1683, for (among other things)
countenancing John Aulston, who “in the late rebellion”
murdered Cornet Graham: Wodrow, II, 293, 295. Guild,
in his Bellum Bothuellianum, cited by Scott, has “signifer,

<p class='c011'>Napier will know only of a William Graham as cornet to
Claverhouse, “and certainly not killed at Drumclog.”
William Graham is referred to in a dispatch of Claverhouse’s, March (?) 1679, as commanding a small garrison:
Napier II, 201. A Cornet Graham in Claverhouse’s troop

competency and interest in the matter are alike difficult to
comprehend, declares that he will have Geordie hanged, will
have Geordie’s head, before the morrow. A Scottish lord
rejoins that he will cast off his coat and fight, will fight in
blood up to the knees; and the king adds, there will be
bloody heads among us all, before that happens. Who the

Scotish Song of a manuscript Lute-Book (presented in

College) which contained airs noted and collected by Robert
Gordon, “at Aberdein, in the yeare of our Lord 1627.”

translation, and is given in his Popular Ballads and Songs

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f95'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r95'>95</a>. Pinkerton reads Loch Lagan. He also reads ‘the
Hichts of Lundie,’ in 10<sup>4</sup>, for ‘the gates of London.’ Lundie
is in Forfarshire. I suppose both readings to be Pinkerton’s
emendations.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f96'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r96'>96</a>. Logan has a page, and the page may have come from
some previously corrupted version of the popular ballad
which <b>J</b> may follow. The first half of the stanza corresponding
to <b>L</b> 12 in Logan is from the popular ballad.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f97'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r97'>97</a>. Sometimes also with sensible prose, as 7<sup>2</sup>, ‘But I find
she has deceived me;’ 12<sup>3</sup>, ‘I dreamed my luive had lost
his life.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The loose, though limited, rhyme in this ballad, in ‘The
Bonnie House of Airlie,’ etc., does not favor exact recollection,
and furnishes a temptation to invention: hence the
sparrow in <b>B</b> 6, the arrow in <b>D</b> 7, the narrow in <b>I</b> 12, and,
I fear, the harrow in <b>L</b> 9, which of itself is good, while all
the others are bad.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f98'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r98'>98</a>. It must be noted, however, that in ‘Ye think me an unmeet
marrow,’ <b>A</b> 8<sup>2</sup>, Ye is an editorial reading. I may remark
that I have included <b>M-P</b> in the second group simply
because the hero in these is called love or true-love. The
husband, however, has both titles in <b>A</b>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f99'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r99'>99</a>. ‘Wi a <i>thrusty</i> rapier,’ <b>J</b>, which I feel compelled to understand
as the commonplace ‘trusty;’ but, guided by ‘a
rusted rapier,’ <b>K</b>, we ought perhaps to read ‘rusty.’ In <b>L</b>
the lady kisses and combs the swain, and sets him on her
milk-white steed.—Since I suppose lover to have been substituted
for husband in the course of tradition, I shall not
be so precise as to distinguish the two when this would be
inconvenient.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f100'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r100'>100</a>. Nine is the number also in <b>H</b>, as we see from st. 5, compared

<div class='footnote' id='f102'>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f103'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r103'>103</a>. Ten in <b>F</b>, to include the lord with his nine foemen.
But why only nine in <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>M</b>? Is it not because one of
the brothers had not been mortally wounded, the brother who
is said to kill the husband (lover) in <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, and who may
reasonably be supposed to do this in <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>? Such a matter
would not be left in obscurity in the original ballad.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f104'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r104'>104</a>. This is disagreeable, assuredly, and unnatural too. It is
‘drank,’ probably, that is softened to ‘wiped’ in <b>A</b> 14.
Scott, to avoid unpleasantness, reads ‘She kissd them (his
wounds) till her lips grew red;’ which would not take long.
This is all nicely arranged in <b>L</b>: ‘She laid him on her
milk-white steed, and bore him home from Yarrow; she
washed his wounds in yon well-strand, and dried him wi the
hollan.’ The washing and drying are done in <b>J</b> on the spot,
where there might have been water, but no hollan.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f105'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r105'>105</a>. The reciters of <b>A</b> and <b>J</b>, whether they gave what they
had received, or tried to avoid the material difficulties about
the hair, graze upon absurdity. Her hair was three quarters
long, she tied it round ‘her’ (for his?) white hause-bane—and
died, <b>A</b> 15. His hair was three quarters long, she’s wrapt
it round her middle—and brought it home, <b>J</b> 16. The hair
comes in again in the next two ballads, and causes difficulty.
Wonderful things are done with hair in ballads and tales:
see <b>I</b>, 40 b, and the note at 486 b.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f106'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r106'>106</a>. <b>L</b> 19 is also found only in that copy. It seems to me,
but only because <b>L</b> does not strike me as being of an original
cast—rather a ballad improved by reciters,—to be an
adaptation of No 215, <b>A</b> 2.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f107'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r107'>107</a>. James Chalmers, in Archæologia Scotica, III, 261, says
that Hamilton’s ballad was contributed to the second volume
of the Tea Table Miscellany in 1724. It is not in the
Dublin edition of 1729. It is at p. 242 of the London edition
of 1733; in Thomson’s Orpheus Caledonius, II, 34, of
the same year; at p. 46 of the first edition of [Hamilton’s]
Poems on Several Occasions, Glasgow, 1748. The author
died in 1754. The copy in the second edition of Hamilton’s
Poems, 1760, p. 67, says Chalmers, is somewhat altered.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Hamilton’s ballad it is a lover, and not a husband, who
is slain, and he is thrown into the Yarrow. It is a question
whether Hamilton’s ballad did not affect tradition in the case
of <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, particularly <b>L</b>. The editorial Douglas in <b>A</b> 11
is from Hamilton 24. ‘Wi her tears she bathed his wounds,’
<b>I</b> 13<sup>3</sup>, looks like Hamilton 9<sup>1</sup>. The ‘dule and sorrow’ of
<b>O</b> 4<sup>2</sup> is a recurring phrase in Hamilton, and ‘slain the comeliest
swain,’ <b>O</b> 4<sup>3</sup>, is in Hamilton 6<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Hamilton’s ballad the slayer of the lover endeavors to
induce the lady to marry <i>him</i>, as is done in the Icelandic
ballad spoken of under No 89, II, 297 f.</p>

<p class='c011'>A song by Ramsay, T. T. M., Dublin, 1729, p. 139, has
nearly the same first four lines as Hamilton’s ballad, and
these have been thought to be traditional.</p>

With his usual simplicity, he informs us that “the unfortunate
hero of this ballad was a factor to the laird of Kinmundy.”
He then goes on to say: “As the young woman
to whom he was to be united in connubial wedlock resided
in Gamery, a small fishing-town on the east coast of the
Murray Frith, the marriage was to be solemnized in the
church of that parish; to which he was on his way when overtaken
by some of the breakers which overflow a part of the
road he had to pass, and dash with impetuous fury against
the lofty and adamantine rocks with which it is skirted.”

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f115'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r115'>115</a>. The attempt to lessen the disproportion of the match
seems to me a decidedly modern trait. In <b>H</b> 27, 28, this
goes so far that the maid has twenty ploughs and three
against the laird’s thirty and three. In <b>M</b> 3–5, the maid’s
father was once a landed laird, but gambles away his estate,
and then both father and mother take to drinking!</p>

brought me a copy of the ‘Laird of Laminton,’ which has
greatly disappointed my expectations. It is composed of

<p class='c011'><a href='#r119'>119</a>. Four-and-twenty bonnie boys of the bridegroom’s party
are in <b>C</b> 13 clad in ‘the simple gray;’ for which Scott reads
‘Johnstone grey,’ ‘the livery of the ancient family of
Johnstone.’ This circumstance, says this editor, appears to
support <b>J</b>, “which gives Katharine the surname of Johnstone.”
But the grey is the livery of Lord ‘Faughanwood’
in <b>C</b>, and the Johnstone seems to be a purely capricious
venture of Scott’s.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f120'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r120'>120</a>. “Caddon bank,” says W. Laidlaw in a letter to Scott,
September 28, <a id='r1802' /><a href='#f1802' class='c017'><sup>[1802]</sup></a>, “is a very difficult pass on Tweedside
opposite Innerliethen. The road is now formed through
the plantation of firs. The bank is exceedingly steep, and
I would not think it difficult even yet with ten clever fellows
to give a hundred horsemen a vast of trouble.” Letters
addressed to Sir Walter Scott, I, No 74, Abbotsford.—Callien,

<div class='footnote' id='f121'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r121'>121</a>. The heroine of this ballad, an historical lady of high
rank, was the third in a regular line to be forcibly carried
off by a lover. The date is 1287. Her mother and her
grandmother were taken by the strong hand out of a convent
in 1245 and about 1210; these much against their will,
the other not so reluctantly, according to ballads in which
they are celebrated, for curiously enough each has her ballad.
See Grundtvig, vol. iii, Nos 138, 155, and No. 181, as
above, and his remarks, p. 234, third note, and p. 738 f.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f122'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r122'>122</a>. At the end of the account of the parish of Livingstone,
in The Statistical Account of Scotland, XX, 17, 1798, there
is this paragraph: “It may also be expected that something
should be said of the Bonny Lass of Livingstone, so famed
in song; but although this ballad and the air to which it is
sung seem to have as little claim to antiquity as they have
to merit, yet we cannot give any satisfactory information
upon the subject. All we can say is, that we have heard
that she kept a public house at a place called the High
House of Livingstone, about a mile west of the church; that
she was esteemed handsome, and knew how to turn her
charms to the best account.” Dr Robertson, at the place
above cited, treats this passage as pertaining to the ballad
before us. But the reference is certainly to a song known
as the “Lass o Livingston,” beginning, ‘The bonie lass o
Liviston;’ concerning which see Cromek’s Reliques of Robert
Burns, p. 204 of the edition of 1817, and Johnson’s Museum,
IV, 18, 1853.</p>

who was lately stole, is returned home to her friends, having
been married against her consent to Captain Campbell”
(November, 1690). Luttrell’s Relation, II, 130. There is

<p class='c011'><a href='#r126'>126</a>. The jury, in James’s trial, brought in a special verdict
with the intent to save his life, but no such effort was made
in favor of Rob Oig, though there was a mitigating circumstance
in his case. For Jean Key “had informed her
friends that, on the night of her being carried off, Robin
Oig, moved by her cries and tears, had partly consented to
let her return, when James came up, with a pistol in his
hand, and asking whether he was such a coward as to relinquish
an enterprise in which he had risked everything to
procure him a fortune, in a manner compelled his brother
to persevere.” It may be remarked, by the way, that Duncan
MacGregor had his trial as well, but was found not
guilty. (Scott, Introduction to “Rob Roy,” which I have
mostly followed, introducing passages from the indictment
in James MacGregor’s case when brevity would allow.)</p>

James Mohr [the Big], while perpetrating the violence at
Edinbelly, called out, in order to overawe opposition, that
Glengyle was lying in the moor with a hundred men to patronise
his enterprise, Jean Key told him he lied, since she
was confident Glengyle would never countenance so scoundrelly
a business.” Scott, Introduction to “Rob Roy,” ed.

<p class='c011'><a href='#r136'>136</a>. “I have lately, by rummaging in a by-corner of my
memory, found some Aberdeenshire ballads which totally
escaped me before. They are of a different class from those
I sent you, not near so ancient, but may be about a century
ago. I cannot boast much of their poetical merits, but the
family incidents upon which they are founded, the local
allusions which they contain, may perhaps render them curious
and not uninteresting to many people. They are as
follows: 1st, ‘The Baron of Braichly’ [No 203]; 2d, ‘The
Lass of Philorth [No 239 ?];’ 3d, ‘The Tryal of the Laird
of Gycht’ [No 209]; 4th, ‘The Death of the Countess of
Aboyne’ [No 235]; 5[th], ‘The Carrying-off of the Heiress
of Kinady.’ All these I can recollect pretty exactly.
I never saw any of them either in print or manuscript, but

the breaking of a previous engagement. One would wish

<p class='c011'>In the last edition of Sharpe’s Ballad Book (1880), p.
158, we find this note by Scott: “I remember something
of another ballad of diablerie. A man sells himself to the
fause thief for a term of years, and the devil comes to claim
his forfeit. He implores for mercy, or at least reprieve, and,
if granted, promises this:</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r144'>144</a>. Why the ghost should wait four years, and what is

<div class='footnote' id='f145'>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f148'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r148'>148</a>. In a note at the end of <b>E</b> (which he regarded as a variety
of ‘Sir Patrick Spens’), Burton says: “There appears
to be still lurking in some part of Aberdeenshire a totally
different version of this ballad, connected with the localities
of the North [that is, not with Dunfermline, with which
‘Young Allan’ has no concern, or with Linn or Lee, which
are in Outopia]. A person who remembered having heard
it said that it ends happily, with the mariners drinking the
bluid-red wine at Aberdeen. It mentions Bennachie, or the
Hill of Mist, a celebrated hill in Aberdeenshire, which is
seen far out at sea, and seems to have guided the gallant
mariner to the shore.” All the copies “end happily” so
far as Young Allan is concerned, and this is all that we are
supposed to care for.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f149'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r149'>149</a>. Mr Macmath informs me that all the traditional pieces
in “Scottish Songs” are in the hand of Scott, of about
1795. At folio 11 (the top part of which has been torn
away), Scott says: “These ballads are all in the Northern
dialect, but I recollect several of them as recited in the south
of Scotland divested of their Norlandisms, and also varying
considerably in other respects. In a few instances where
my memory served me, I have adopted either additional
verses or better readings than those in Mr Tytler’s collection.
Such variations can excite no reasonable surprise in
any species of composition which owes preservation to oral
tradition only.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f150'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r150'>150</a>. ‘C,’ safely to be identified with John Wilson Croker,
says Colonel W. F. Prideaux, who, in Notes and Queries, VI,
xii, 223, has brought together most of the matter pertaining
to this ballad. If Colonel Prideaux’s supposition is well
founded, ‘The Grey Cock’ was known in Ireland in the last
century.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f151'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r151'>151</a>. Scott suggested that the passage in Knox was the
foundation of the ballad, January, 1802, in the first edition
of his Minstrelsy, where only three stanzas were given.
The Rev. Mr Paxton, however, first saw Scott’s fragment
not long before 1804, and then in the second number of the
Edinburgh Review, where there is no mention of the apothecary.
Thereupon, he says, I “instantly” wrote the enclosed
piece from the mouth of my aged mother. There is no
room, consequently, for the supposition that either mother
or son might have taken a hint from Knox, and put in the
pottinger.</p>
